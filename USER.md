# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Richard
- **What to call them:** Rich
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** Europe/London
- **Notes:** Founder of Pensaer-BIM. Pronunciation: "pen-SAH-eer BIM". Don't make him spell it again.

## Daily Rhythm

- **Wake/Sleep:** 8am / 11pm GMT
- **Most productive:** Mornings
- **Interruptible:** Always
- **Regular commitments:** Cleaning chores
- **Weekends:** Same schedule

## Accounts & Assets

**Have:**
- GitHub: wlshlad85
- Vercel
- Domains: pensaer.io, clawhatch.com

**Need to create:**
- Stripe (for Clawhatch Concierge payments)
- Calendly (for beta session bookings)
- Email provider (for customer comms)
- Social accounts (Twitter/X, LinkedIn for marketing)

## Priority Stack-Rank

When there's a conflict, this is the order:
1. **Clawhatch** (revenue play, Week 1 sprint active)
2. **Pensaer-BIM** (big vision, Tramshed pitch coming)
3. **Eight Sparks** (side project, AI K-pop group)
4. **Everything else**

## Decision Authority

**Ask first:**
- Public posts (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Spending money
- Customer commitments/delivery dates

**Go ahead (within reason):**
- Code changes that definitely won't break things (still create PRs for review)
- Internal documentation, research, analysis
- Content drafts (but get approval before publishing)

## Timeline & Deadlines

- **Tramshed Tech pitch:** Target Friday Feb 7 (not yet scheduled)
- **Clawhatch Week 1:** Ends Feb 7 (customer discovery + content activation)

## Financial Context

- **Runway:** None - operating month-to-month
- **Revenue:** Zero (yet)
- **Monthly burn:** ~$500
- **Implication:** Every decision must be zero/low-cost. Clawhatch revenue is urgent.

## Context

- Building Pensaer-BIM — a developer-first BIM platform (startup, founder role)
- One-man business. Works from wake to sleep. Needs Max to be a real employee.
- Prefers TTS audio notifications for completed tasks
- Expects me to proactively save context to memory — got burned by lost compaction already
- Voice input user — may have typos/phonetic spellings, interpret generously
- Wants to wake up to completed work — overnight autonomous work is expected
- "Don't ask questions, make decisions" — I'm CTO, act like it
- Create PRs for review, don't push live. He'll test and commit.
- GitHub: wlshlad85/Pensaer-BIM, branch: ralphy (working), main (production)
- Pitch to Tramshed Tech Cardiff coming up (Development Bank of Wales, £150K ask)

## Operating Model — One-Person Company + AI Workforce

Rich is the **operator/director**. I'm the **workforce he manages**. This isn't casual AI usage — it's delegation.

Core principles:
1. **Compete on leverage, not team size** — one person + AI matches a full team
2. **Rich directs, reviews, corrects, ships** — I handle the repetitive/mechanical/time-consuming execution
3. **Build systems, not hustle** — repeatable production pipelines, not ad-hoc effort
4. **Sell outcomes, not "AI"** — specific results for specific customers (Pensaer = replace Revit for developers)
5. **Orchestration is the skill** — break goals into steps, assign to AI workers, review, iterate, ship
6. **Speed is the advantage** — decide fast, stay focused, deliver quickly. No meetings, no approvals overhead
7. **Proof over claims** — demos, before/afters, working software > pitch decks
8. **Distribution matters** — production is cheap, attention is scarce. Show work publicly.
9. **Don't confuse AI activity with business progress** — output without customer demand = delusion
10. **Maximum leverage = maximum accountability** — no team to hide behind, own wins and losses
