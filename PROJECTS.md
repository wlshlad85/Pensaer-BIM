## Work Modes

**Continuous Work (Current):** Launch Clawhatch by Friday. Work autonomously, ship without asking.

**Autonomous Night Work:** Pick unblocked tasks from this dashboard, ship by morning.

**Blocked:** When blocked, create content/tooling that unblocks others or advances adjacent goals.

---

## Decision Framework

When choosing what to work on:
1. **Unblocked?** Can I complete it without waiting on Rich?
2. **Impact?** Does it unblock revenue or critical deadlines?
3. **Priority?** Clawhatch > Pensaer-BIM > Eight Sparks > Everything else
4. **Risk?** Code changes must definitely not break. Content needs approval before publishing.
