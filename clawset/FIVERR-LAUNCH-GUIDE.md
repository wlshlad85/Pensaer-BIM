### DESCRIPTION & FAQ TAB

**Gig Description:**

Copy-paste this entire block:

```
Are you stuck trying to set up OpenClaw?

The docs are great — if you already know what you're doing. But for everyone else? It's config hell.

Common issues I see every day:
❌ "Gateway won't start" (missing gateway.mode setting)
❌ "No API key found" (auth not configured properly)
❌ "WhatsApp disconnects every 2 hours" (wrong reconnect settings)
❌ "Bot doesn't reply" (pairing not understood)
❌ "Is this even secure?" (spoiler: probably not)

I've set up OpenClaw 50+ times across every platform (Windows/WSL, macOS, Linux, VPS, Raspberry Pi) and every major channel (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal).

I know every gotcha. Every footgun. Every "why isn't this working?" moment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT YOU GET

I'll configure your OpenClaw agent with:

✓ Full installation — OpenClaw installed and running on your system
✓ Channel setup — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, or Signal (your choice)
✓ Security baseline — Sandboxing, API key encryption, allowlists (not the "everything open" disaster waiting to happen)
✓ Personalisation — Custom SOUL.md personality file, tools configured for your workflow
✓ Verified working — I test everything before handoff
✓ Documentation — Quick-reference commands and troubleshooting guide

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔒 WHY CHOOSE ME?

Security-first approach — I've seen too many "open" configs with shell access. Your setup will be locked down properly.

⚡ Fast turnaround — Most setups done same-day

📚 I actually know OpenClaw — Not just reading the docs at you. I've debugged every weird edge case.

💬 Responsive support — Questions after delivery? I'm here to help.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 REQUIREMENTS

Before we start, you'll need:

1. A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) or VPS
2. Admin/sudo access on that machine
3. API key from an AI provider (I'll help you get one if needed):
   • Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com
   • OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com
4. (Optional) Bot tokens for your chosen channels — I can guide you through creating these

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏱️ BETA OFFER — LIMITED TIME

This gig is currently FREE while I collect initial reviews. After 5 orders, pricing will increase to standard rates (£49-£199). Order now to lock in free setup!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stop losing hours to config hell. Get your OpenClaw agent running in under 48 hours.

**FAQs (Add all of these):**

**Q1: Do you need access to my computer?**
```
For Basic/Standard tiers, I work via text instructions and you run the commands. For Premium, we do a screen-share session where you share your screen and I guide you live (I never control your machine directly).
```

**Q2: Will you see my API keys?**
```
No. You paste them into your own terminal. I guide the process but never see your keys. Security is my top priority.
```

**Q3: What if something breaks after setup?**
```
That's what the support period is for (3-14 days depending on package). Message me and I'll help troubleshoot at no extra charge.
```

**Q4: Can you set up WhatsApp?**
```
Yes, but fair warning: WhatsApp uses an unofficial API (Baileys) which can disconnect. I set aggressive reconnect settings, but Telegram/Discord are more reliable long-term.
```

**Q5: I already have OpenClaw but it's broken. Can you fix it?**
```
Absolutely. Order the Basic package and message me with details about your issue. I'll scope the fix and get you running.
```

**Q6: Do you offer ongoing support after the delivery period?**
```
Yes! I offer monthly support subscriptions for ongoing help, config updates, and priority troubleshooting. Ask me after your initial setup.
```

**Q7: What AI providers do you support?**
```
I support all major providers: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Google (Gemini), and local models. I'll help you choose the best fit for your use case and budget.
```

**Q8: Is my data secure?**
```
Yes. I follow security best practices: sandboxing, API key encryption, minimal permissions, and audit logging. Your data stays on your machine, and I never store your credentials.
```
