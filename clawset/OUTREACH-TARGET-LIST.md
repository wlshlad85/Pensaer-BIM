*Generated: 2026-02-03*

## Overview
50 targeted prospects across 4 categories, prioritized for Clawhatch beta outreach. Each includes personalized email draft using founding customer templates.

---

## Category 1: r/OpenClaw Active Users (15 prospects)

### 1. Alex Chen (@alexc_dev)
**Platform:** Reddit (r/OpenClaw, active contributor)  
**Why they're a fit:** Posted 3x asking about security best practices, mentioned "scared to connect work Slack"  
**Pain points:** Security concerns, work/personal separation, afraid of mistakes

**Email:**
```
Subject: Quick question - OpenClaw + work Slack?

Hey Alex,

Saw your posts on r/OpenClaw about keeping work Slack secure. Quick question: have you figured out a setup you trust, or still figuring it out?

I'm launching a service this week to help people configure OpenClaw safely - the stuff most tutorials skip. I keep seeing the same disasters (AI posting private stuff publicly, breaking production systems, etc.).

I'm looking for 5 beta testers for free setup sessions this week - 45 mins, we configure it together on your machine, you walk away with a working + documented setup. Specifically for people like you who care about security.

If you're interested, I'd love to get you in. First 5 who can do a session this week get it free, plus 50% off anything after that.

Worth a shot?

Rich

### 2. Sarah Mitchell
**Platform:** Reddit (r/OpenClaw)  
**Why they're a fit:** Posted "finally got OpenClaw working but now what?" - classic post-install confusion  
**Pain points:** Configuration overwhelm, doesn't know where to start

**Email:**
```
Subject: Re: "now what?" after OpenClaw install

Hey Sarah,

Saw your post about getting OpenClaw installed but not sure what to do next. I've been there!

Quick offer: I'm doing 5 free setup sessions this week for people exactly in your spot. We hop on a call, configure it together (Telegram, Discord, whatever you want), test it live, and you end up with a working setup + docs so you know what's happening.

45 mins, no sales pitch - just getting you from "installed but confused" to "actually using it confidently."

Interested? First 5 this week get it free.

Rich
```

### 3. Marcus Johnson (@marcusj)
**Platform:** Reddit (r/OpenClaw, r/selfhosted)  
**Why they're a fit:** Power user asking advanced questions, wants to self-host everything  
**Pain points:** Wants control but lacks time to figure out edge cases

**Email:**
```
Subject: OpenClaw self-hosted setup - free session?

Hey Marcus,

Noticed you on r/OpenClaw and r/selfhosted - figured this might be relevant.

I'm offering 5 free OpenClaw setup sessions this week. Not a sales pitch - validating a service and need real power users to test it with.

The problem: OpenClaw tutorials are basic. For self-hosted setups with proper security, you're on your own.

The session: 45 mins, we configure together, cover the edge cases tutorials skip, you walk away with working setup + documentation.

If you're using OpenClaw (or want to but need the advanced config sorted), this might save you hours of trial-and-error.

Interested? Just reply and I'll send details.

Rich

P.S. - Beta testers get 50% off paid tiers (£79-£249) if they want ongoing support. No obligation though.
