**Subject:** Quick question - using OpenClaw?

---

Hey [NAME],

Quick question: are you using OpenClaw (or thinking about it)?

I'm launching a service this week to help people set it up safely. Most tutorials skip the security stuff, and I keep seeing the same disasters (AI posting private stuff publicly, breaking production systems, etc.).

I'm looking for 5 beta testers to do free setup sessions this week - 45 mins, we configure it together on your machine, you walk away with a working + documented setup.

If you're interested (or know someone who is), I'd love to get you in. First 5 who can do a session this week get it free, plus 50% off anything after that.

Worth a shot?

## Template: Cold Outreach (Tech Community)

**Subject:** Free OpenClaw setup for [COMMUNITY] members

---

Hi [NAME],

I saw you're active in [COMMUNITY] - figured this might be relevant.

I'm offering 5 free OpenClaw setup sessions this week. Not a sales pitch - I'm validating a service before launch and need real users to test it with.

The problem: OpenClaw setup is powerful but risky. Most people wing it, then regret it when their AI starts doing things they didn't authorize.

The session: 45 mins, remote, we configure it together on your machine. You learn the security stuff, walk away with working setup + docs.

If you're using OpenClaw (or want to but worried about setup), this might save you hours of trial-and-error.

Interested? Just reply and I'll send details.

Best,  
Rich

P.S. - Beta testers get 50% off paid tiers (£79-£249) if they want ongoing support. No obligation though.

## Template: LinkedIn DM

Hey [NAME] - noticed you're into AI automation. Quick question:

Are you using OpenClaw or considering it? I'm launching a setup service this week (security-focused, not just "follow this tutorial" stuff).

Looking for 5 beta testers for free sessions this week. 45 mins, remote, we configure together, you get working setup + docs.

If interested (or you know someone who is), lmk. First 5 get in.

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Day 1: Send initial outreach
### Day 3: If no response, send:

**Subject:** Re: Quick question - using OpenClaw?

Hey [NAME],

Following up in case this got buried. Still have 2 beta spots left for free OpenClaw setup sessions this week.

If timing's bad or it's not relevant, no worries - just didn't want you to miss it if you were interested.

Rich

### Day 7: If interest but no booking:

**Subject:** Last call - beta spots filling up

Hey [NAME],

Just a heads-up - down to the last beta spot. If you still want in, lmk by EOD today. Otherwise I'll open it to the waitlist.

Either way, no pressure. Thanks for considering it.

## Targeting Strategy

### Tier 1: Warm Contacts (Highest Conversion)
- People you've talked to about AI/automation
- Developers you know personally
- Anyone who's mentioned OpenClaw or similar tools
- Tech community members you've engaged with

**Approach:** Personal email, reference shared context  
**Goal:** 2-3 beta testers from warm contacts

### Tier 2: Community Cold Outreach (Medium Conversion)
- r/OpenClaw active contributors  
- Discord/Telegram AI communities
- Indie hacker communities (Hacker News, Indie Hackers)
- Dev Twitter mutuals

**Approach:** Community-focused, low pressure  
**Goal:** 1-2 beta testers from community

### Tier 3: Targeted Cold (Low Conversion, High Volume)
- LinkedIn search: "AI automation" + "developer"
- Twitter search: recent OpenClaw mentions
- GitHub: starred openclaw/openclaw repo

**Approach:** High volume, expect 1-5% response rate  
**Goal:** 0-1 beta tester if Tier 1+2 don't fill slots

## Response Handling

### When someone says YES:
```
Great! A few quick questions to make sure we're a fit:

1. What do you want to use OpenClaw for? (work/personal/both)
2. Which channels? (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, etc.)
3. Any specific security concerns? (e.g., work Slack, company data)

Once I know that, I'll send a Calendly link to book the session. Sessions are ~45 mins, remote (Zoom/Discord/whatever works for you).

Sound good?
```

### When someone says MAYBE:
```
No pressure! Happy to answer any questions first.

The session is basically:
- We hop on a call
- Configure OpenClaw together on your machine (I walk you through it)
- Test it with me watching so we catch issues immediately  
- You end up with working setup + docs

If you're on the fence, I can send you the manual checklist I use so you can see what we'd cover. Then you can decide if a session would help.

Want the checklist?
```

### When someone says NO:
```
All good! If you know anyone who might be interested, feel free to pass it along.

And if you change your mind later, the paid tiers launch end of Feb (£79-£249 depending on what you need).

Good luck with your setup!
```

**Week 2 (Feb 10-14):**
- Launch paid tiers publicly
- Convert 1-2 beta testers to Support £29/mo
- Get first "cold" customer (not from beta)

**Week 3-4:**
- Hit £150-£300 MRR (3-5 Support subscribers + 1-2 one-time purchases)
- Validate wizard demand (how many ask "is there a DIY version?")
