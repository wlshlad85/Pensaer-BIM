# Post-Session Email Sequence

**Purpose:** Nurture beta testers → paying customers + referrals  
**Timeline:** 7 emails over 30 days  
**Goal:** 33% conversion to Support subscription or one-time purchase

---

## Email 1: Immediate Post-Session (Send within 2 hours)

**Subject:** Your OpenClaw setup docs + quick feedback request

---

Hi [NAME],

Thanks for the session today! Your OpenClaw agent should be humming along nicely now.

**Attached:** Your setup documentation (exactly what we configured, why we chose each option, and troubleshooting steps).

**Quick favor:** If you run into any issues in the next 48 hours, shoot me a message. I want to make sure everything's working smoothly before I consider this "done."

**Even quicker favor:** What was the most valuable part of the session for you? I'm using beta feedback to shape the service, and your input directly influences what I build.

Just hit reply — takes 30 seconds.

Cheers,  
Rich

P.S. — Your beta access includes 7 days of email support. If something breaks or you have questions, I've got you.

---

## Email 2: Day 3 Check-In

**Subject:** How's your OpenClaw agent doing?

---

Hey [NAME],

Quick check-in: How's the agent working out?

Any surprises (good or bad)? Anything you wish we'd configured differently?

I'm here for another 4 days (part of the beta support period), so if you want to adjust anything, now's the time.

Also — random question: Are you using it more or less than you expected? I'm curious how real-world usage compares to what people think they'll do.

Best,  
Rich

## Email 3: Day 7 — Support Offer

**Subject:** Beta support ends today — want to keep it going?

---

Hi [NAME],

Heads up: Your 7-day beta support period ends today.

If you want to extend it, I'm launching a **Support subscription** next week:

**£29/month** gets you:
→ Ongoing config help (if you want to add channels, tools, etc.)
→ Priority troubleshooting (24-hour response time)
→ Security updates (I'll notify you of config risks as they emerge)
→ Monthly "office hours" group call (Q&A with me + other subscribers)

**Beta tester price: £14.50/month** (50% off, forever)

Not trying to upsell you if you don't need it — plenty of people do great with the setup we did and never need help again.

But if you want a safety net, this is it.

Interested? Just reply and I'll send the signup link when it goes live next week.

Best,  
Rich

P.S. — No hard feelings if you pass. Seriously. I built Clawhatch to help people, not create dependency.

---

## Email 4: Day 14 — Referral Request

**Subject:** Know anyone struggling with OpenClaw setup?

---

Hey [NAME],

Hope the agent is treating you well!

Quick question: Do you know anyone else who's:
→ Thinking about OpenClaw but intimidated by setup?
→ Tried setup and got stuck?
→ Using OpenClaw for work and worried about security?

I've got 3 more beta spots opening up this week (I'm running these in batches to manage time).

If you know someone who'd benefit, feel free to send them my way. I'll take care of them the same way I took care of you.

**Referral bonus:** If they book a session and mention your name, you get 3 months of Support subscription free (if you're subscribed) or £25 credit toward any Clawhatch service (if not).

Not asking you to shill for me — just putting it out there if you happen to know someone.

Cheers,  
Rich

---

## Email 5: Day 21 — Case Study Request

**Subject:** Can I feature your setup as a case study?

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm writing up case studies from the beta sessions to show people what Clawhatch actually does (real setups, not marketing fluff).

Would you be cool with me featuring your setup?

**What I'd include:**
→ Your use case (work/personal, which channels)
→ What we configured (high-level, no private details)
→ The security issues we caught
→ A quote from you about the experience (if you're willing)

**What I'd keep private:**
→ Your full name (I'd use first name or initials)
→ Company name (unless you want it mentioned)
→ Any specific config details

**In return:**
→ I'll send you the draft before publishing (you have veto power)
→ You get a backlink if you have a site/portfolio
→ Free upgrade to Enterprise tier if you ever want the wizard

No pressure — totally optional. But if you're game, it'd help me show people what "good setup" actually looks like.

Let me know!

Rich

## Email 7: Day 60 — Long-Term Check-In

**Subject:** Still running smoothly?

---

Hi [NAME],

It's been 2 months since we did your OpenClaw setup. Just checking in:

→ Still working well?
→ Anything you wish you'd done differently?
→ Any features you'd want in a future version of Clawhatch?

I'm planning the next phase of the product (automated security monitoring, team management tools, etc.) and I always start with beta tester feedback.

If you've got 2 minutes, I'd love to hear what would make Clawhatch more valuable for you.

And if everything's just humming along and you don't need anything — awesome. That's exactly what I hoped would happen.

Best,  
Rich

## Tracking & Optimization

**Create: `clawset/beta-cohort.md`**

```markdown
# Beta Cohort Tracking

| Name | Session Date | Email 1 | Email 3 | Email 7 | Subscribed? | Purchased? | Referred? |
|------|--------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| [NAME] | Feb 4 | ✅ Opened | ✅ Replied | 🔜 Pending | Yes (£14.50/mo) | No | 1 referral |
| [NAME] | Feb 5 | ✅ Opened | ❌ No reply | 🔜 Pending | No | No | 0 |
```

**Metrics to track:**
- Email open rates (should be >70% for this audience)
- Reply rates (indicator of engagement)
- Subscription conversion (target: 20-30%)
- One-time purchase conversion (target: 10-15%)
- Referrals per beta tester (target: 0.5-1.0)
- Churn after first month (target: <10%)

**Optimize based on:**
- If Email 3 gets low replies → adjust check-in tone (too salesy?)
- If Email 7 gets low conversion → discount not compelling enough?
- If referrals are low → increase incentive or simplify process
- If case study requests get rejected → offer more value (backlink, bigger discount)
