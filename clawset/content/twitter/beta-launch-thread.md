# Twitter/X Beta Launch Thread

## Thread Structure
*10-tweet thread announcing Clawhatch beta program*

---

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
OpenClaw is powerful.

It's also a loaded gun pointed at your digital life.

One wrong config = your AI posting to Twitter. Reading your emails. Running arbitrary code.

We're fixing that. 🧵

---

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Setting up OpenClaw safely requires:
• Understanding OAuth scopes
• Configuring channel allowlists  
• Setting tool policies correctly
• Testing permissions in isolation
• Documenting what you changed

Most people skip this. Then regret it.

---

### Tweet 3 (The Stakes)
I've seen:
• AI agents posting private DMs publicly
• Bots deleting production databases
• Personal photos shared to work Slack
• Credit cards charged by confused automation

These aren't edge cases. This is what happens when smart people rush setup.

---

### Tweet 4 (Why It's Hard)
OpenClaw's power = OpenClaw's risk.

The same flexibility that makes it amazing makes it dangerous.

You're not stupid for struggling with setup. You're smart for being cautious.

---

### Tweet 5 (Introducing Clawhatch)
We built Clawhatch because we kept seeing the same disasters.

Three pillars:
🛡️ Safe baseline (locked-down config, expand gradually)
🎨 Personalised (your workflows, not ours)
🔧 Maintained (security updates, not "set and forget")

---

### Tweet 6 (Beta Program)
We're looking for 5 beta testers.

You get:
✅ Free 45-min guided setup session  
✅ Custom security baseline for your use case
✅ Documentation you can actually use
✅ Direct line to us for questions

We get: feedback on what actually helps.

---

### Tweet 7 (Who Should Apply)
Perfect if you:
• Want OpenClaw but anxious about setup
• Tried setup, broke something, gave up
• Need it for work (extra high stakes)
• Have complex requirements (multi-channel, team access)

NOT for: "I'll figure it out eventually" people.

---

### Tweet 8 (What Happens)
1. Book 45-min session (we use YOUR machine, no cloud risks)
2. We configure together, explaining every choice
3. You test it with us watching (catch issues immediately)
4. Walk away with documented, working, SAFE setup

Then: optional £29/mo support or go solo. Your call.

---

### Tweet 9 (After Beta)
After beta (late Feb):
• Pro tier £79 - DIY guided wizard + audit tool
• Enterprise £149 - Wizard + priority support  
• Concierge £249 - White-glove setup session

Beta testers: 50% off any tier, lifetime.
