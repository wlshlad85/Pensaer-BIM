# Free OpenClaw Setup — First 5 Beta Testers

**I'll set up your OpenClaw agent for free. You give me feedback.**

---

## Who I Am

I've set up OpenClaw 50+ times across every platform (Windows/WSL, macOS, Linux, VPS, Raspberry Pi) and every major channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal). I know every gotcha, every "why isn't this working?" moment, and every security footgun.

I'm building **Clawhatch** — a service that does professional OpenClaw setups so you don't lose days to config hell. Before I launch, I want to do 5 completely free setups with real users to validate that what I've built actually solves the problems you face.

---

## What You Get (Completely Free)

**30-45 minute video call where I:**
- Install OpenClaw + configure it for your specific use case
- Set up your chosen channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal — your pick)
- Configure security baseline:
  - Proper sandboxing (not the "everything open" footgun)
  - API key encryption (never in plaintext configs)
  - Allowlists for tools and channels
- Personalise your agent:
  - Tools you actually need (not a bloated feature set)
  - Personality that fits your vibe (SOUL.md)
  - Custom config for your environment (WSL vs bare Linux, etc.)
- **Follow-up support for 1 week** — if something breaks or you get stuck, I'm on call

---

## What I Ask in Return

1. **Honest feedback** — tell me what was confusing, what should've been explained better, where I screwed up
2. **A testimonial** (written or short video) if you're happy with the result
3. **Permission to screen-record the session** (for my own notes + training material — your info stays private, I won't publish without asking)

---

## Who This Is For

You're a good fit if you:
- Want to use OpenClaw but the setup docs are overwhelming
- Tried to set it up yourself and got stuck (auth errors, channels not working, gateway won't start)
- Want security done right from day one (not bolted on later)
- Are willing to hop on a call and walk through setup together

You're **not** a good fit if:
- You've already got OpenClaw running perfectly (though I do offer security audits — DM me)
- You're uncomfortable with screen-sharing / video calls
- You just want to lurk and watch — this is hands-on, interactive

---

## How It Works

1. **Fill out this intake form:** [INSERT CALENDLY LINK HERE]
   - Your OS, current install status, what you want to automate
   - Preferred time slots (I'll work around your schedule)
2. **I'll send you a Zoom/Discord link** 24 hours before the session
3. **We hop on the call** and get you fully set up in 30-45 minutes
4. **You test it for a week** — I'm on Telegram/Discord if you hit issues
5. **You send me feedback** — what worked, what didn't, how it felt

---

## Why Free?

I'm not being altruistic — I'm doing customer discovery. Every person who's tried to set up OpenClaw has hit *different* walls. The docs are great but they're reference material, not a step-by-step "hold my hand" walkthrough. I want to see where people get confused **in real-time** so I can build a setup wizard that doesn't require a human.

Once I've done these 5 sessions, I'm packaging everything I learned into an automated wizard + paid setup service. You're getting the white-glove version for free before I charge £249 for it.

## Booking Link

**[INSERT CALENDLY LINK HERE]**

First 5 people who book a slot get the free setup. After that, I'm charging.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to have OpenClaw installed already?**  
A: Nope. We can start from scratch. If you've tried and it's half-broken, even better — I'll fix it.

**Q: What if I don't have API keys yet?**  
A: We'll set them up together. I'll walk you through getting Anthropic/OpenAI keys.

**Q: Can you do WhatsApp setup?**  
A: Yes, but WhatsApp is finicky (unofficial API via Baileys). I'll get you connected and set up aggressive reconnect settings, but expect some maintenance. Telegram/Discord are more stable.

**Q: I'm on Windows. Does it work?**  
A: Yes. We'll set up WSL2 + systemd if you don't have it. Takes an extra 10 minutes but it's doable.

**Q: What if I can't make the scheduled time?**  
A: Just reschedule via Calendly. I'm flexible.

**Q: Will you see my API keys?**  
A: No. You'll paste them into your own terminal. I'll guide you but I never see your keys.

**Q: What's the catch?**  
A: There isn't one. I need real-world feedback before I launch a paid product. You get a free setup, I get validation. Win-win.

## About Clawhatch

Clawhatch is a setup + security service for OpenClaw. Think of it as "OpenClaw, done right, in 10 minutes instead of 10 hours."

Three pillars:
1. **Safe baseline** — security baked in from day one (sandboxing, key encryption, allowlists)
2. **Personalised** — built for your workflow, not a generic template
3. **Maintained** — optional ongoing support so it doesn't break when OpenClaw updates

After these 5 beta sessions, I'm launching with:
- **Free tier:** Automated setup wizard (self-service)
- **Pro tier (£79 founding price):** Advanced config packages
- **Concierge tier (£249 founding price):** 1:1 setup like what you're getting for free right now

If you're reading this and thinking "damn, I should've been first" — the paid launch is in 3 weeks. You can still get founding-customer pricing (47% off list price). [Sign up for launch notification here: INSERT LINK]

*Your OpenClaw agent, set up safely and built for you*

**P.S.** If you've already got OpenClaw running but you're not sure if it's secure, I also offer free security audits. DM me your `config.yaml` (redact your API keys obviously) and I'll send you a report of what's misconfigured and how to fix it.
