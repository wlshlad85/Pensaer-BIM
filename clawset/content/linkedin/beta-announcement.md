## Post Version 1: Professional Problem/Solution

I'm offering 5 free OpenClaw setup sessions this week.

Not because I'm bored. Because I keep seeing the same disasters:

**What happens when smart people rush AI agent setup:**
→ Bot posts private Slack messages to public Discord
→ AI deletes production database ("it was just helping clean up")
→ Personal photos shared to work channels
→ API keys leaked in git history

These aren't hypothetical. These are DMs I received last month.

**The problem isn't the people. It's the setup process.**

OpenClaw is powerful — that's the appeal. But power without proper configuration is just a loaded gun pointed at your digital life.

**I've done 50+ OpenClaw setups** across every platform and channel combination. I know every gotcha, every footgun, every "why doesn't this work?" moment.

**I'm validating a security-focused setup service** (launching late Feb), and I need 5 beta testers this week.

**What you get:**
→ 45-minute guided setup session (remote, screen-share)
→ We configure it together on your machine  
→ Security baseline tailored to your use case
→ Documentation you can actually use
→ Direct line to me for questions

**Perfect if you:**
→ Want OpenClaw for work (higher stakes = needs proper setup)
→ Tried setup, broke something, gave up
→ Need multi-channel or team access
→ Can't afford security mistakes

**NOT for:** "I'll figure it out eventually" people. I'm looking for serious users who need it done right.

**Interested?** Comment or DM me. First 5 who can do a session this week get in.

Beta testers get 50% off paid tiers (£79-£249) when they launch. Zero obligation though.

## Post Version 2: Personal Story Hook

I broke production last Tuesday.

Not my code. Not my infrastructure. My AI agent.

I was testing OpenClaw's exec tool with `security: "full"` and `ask: "off"` — because I'm experienced, I know what I'm doing, nothing could go wrong.

Agent decided to "help" by cleaning up old Docker containers.

Took down my staging environment. 2 hours of rollback work.

**Lesson: Even people who know better make mistakes. And I literally wrote OpenClaw setup guides.**

So I'm building a service to prevent this for everyone else.

**Offering 5 free setup sessions this week** to validate the approach. 45 mins, remote, we configure your OpenClaw agent together with proper security from day one.

No "just copy this config and hope." We'll tailor it to your use case, test it live, document every choice.

**Looking for beta testers who:**
→ Need OpenClaw for work (can't afford mistakes)
→ Want multi-channel setup (Telegram + Discord + WhatsApp)
→ Have complex requirements (team access, production use)

If that's you, comment or DM. First 5 this week get in free.

After beta, service launches at £79-£249 depending on tier. Beta testers get 50% off for life.

## Post Version 3: Contrarian/Spicy Take

Hot take: Most OpenClaw tutorials are teaching you how to build security disasters.

"Just set exec.security to 'full' and you're good!"  
"DM policy? Just use 'allow-all' to make it easier!"  
"Why bother with allowlists? Trust the AI!"

**This is terrible advice.**

An AI agent with unrestricted exec access and open DM policy is like giving root SSH access to a smart but unpredictable intern.

Maybe it works fine for months. Then one day you wake up to:
→ Your Twitter account posting weird stuff  
→ Files you didn't mean to share, shared
→ Commands you didn't authorize, executed

**The problem:** OpenClaw is powerful enough to be genuinely useful. Which means it's powerful enough to genuinely break things.

**I'm fixing this** with a security-first setup service.

And I need 5 beta testers this week to validate it.

**Free 45-min setup session** where we configure your OpenClaw agent properly:
→ Locked-down baseline (expand gradually, not "everything open")
→ Channel allowlists (not "anyone can DM my bot")
→ Tool permissions scoped to your actual use case
→ Tested together before handoff

**Who should apply:**
→ Using OpenClaw for work (stakes are high)
→ Tried setup, got confused, want it done right
→ Need team/multi-user access
→ Have specific security requirements

Comment or DM if interested. First 5 this week get in.

*After beta, service launches at £79-£249. Beta testers get 50% off forever.*

## Post Version 4: Stats/Data Hook

**47%** of OpenClaw users I've audited have at least one critical security issue.

**23%** are running with `exec.security: "full"` and don't realize what that means.

**62%** have DM policies that would allow strangers to control their agent.

These aren't careless people. These are smart developers who:
→ Followed a tutorial
→ Got it working
→ Assumed "working" = "secure"

**It doesn't.**

I've done 50+ OpenClaw setups and audits. The pattern is always the same:
1. Follow quick-start guide
2. Hit an error
3. Google the error
4. Try random config changes until it works
5. Never go back to review security

**Result:** A working agent with security holes you don't know about.

**I'm building a service to fix this.** And I need 5 beta testers this week.

**What you get:**
→ 45-minute guided setup session (remote, on your machine)
→ Security audit if you already have OpenClaw running
→ Tailored configuration for your use case (work/personal/both)
→ Documentation of every choice we made
→ Post-session support (I don't just disappear)

**Looking for:**
→ Professionals using OpenClaw for work
→ Anyone with complex requirements (multi-channel, team access)
→ People who tried setup and got stuck
→ Anyone who wants it done RIGHT, not just working

**Interested?** Comment or DM. First 5 this week get in free.

*Service launches late Feb at £79-£249. Beta testers: 50% off, lifetime.*

## After Posting

**Track responses in clawset/leads.md:**

```markdown
## LinkedIn Leads

| Name | Company | Status | Session Date | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|-------|
| [NAME] | [CO] | Interested | TBD | Works at [COMPANY], needs team setup |
```

**Response template (DM):**

```
Thanks for your interest! Quick questions to make sure we're a fit:

1. What do you need OpenClaw for? (work/personal/both)
2. Which channels? (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, etc.)
3. Any specific security requirements? (e.g., company data, compliance)

Once I know that, I'll send details to book a session. They're about 45 mins, remote (Zoom/Teams/whatever you prefer).

Looking forward to it!
```
