## Gig Description

### Are you stuck trying to set up OpenClaw?

The docs are great — if you already know what you're doing. But for everyone else? It's config hell.

**Common issues I see every day:**
❌ "Gateway won't start" (missing gateway.mode setting)
❌ "No API key found" (auth not configured properly)
❌ "WhatsApp disconnects every 2 hours" (wrong reconnect settings)
❌ "Bot doesn't reply" (pairing not understood)
❌ "Is this even secure?" (spoiler: probably not)

**I've set up OpenClaw 50+ times** across every platform (Windows/WSL, macOS, Linux, VPS, Raspberry Pi) and every major channel (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal).

I know every gotcha. Every footgun. Every "why isn't this working?" moment.

### What You Get

**I'll configure your OpenClaw agent with:**

✅ **Full installation** — OpenClaw installed and running on your system

✅ **Channel setup** — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, or Signal (your choice)

✅ **Security baseline** — Sandboxing, API key encryption, allowlists (not the "everything open" disaster waiting to happen)

✅ **Personalisation** — Custom SOUL.md personality file, tools configured for your workflow

✅ **Verified working** — I test everything before handoff

✅ **Documentation** — Quick-reference commands and troubleshooting guide

   - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com
4. (Optional) Bot tokens for your chosen channels — I can guide you through creating these

### Why Choose Me?

🔒 **Security-first approach** — I've seen too many "open" configs with shell access. Your setup will be locked down properly.

⚡ **Fast turnaround** — Most setups done same-day

📚 **I actually know OpenClaw** — Not just reading the docs at you. I've debugged every weird edge case.

💬 **Responsive support** — Questions after delivery? I'm here to help.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do you need access to my computer?**
A: For Basic/Standard, I work via text instructions and you run the commands. For Premium, we do a screen-share session where you share your screen and I guide you live (I never control your machine directly).

**Q: Will you see my API keys?**
A: No. You paste them into your own terminal. I guide the process but never see your keys.

**Q: What if something breaks after setup?**
A: That's what the support period is for. Message me and I'll help troubleshoot.

**Q: Can you set up WhatsApp?**
A: Yes, but fair warning: WhatsApp uses an unofficial API (Baileys) which can disconnect. I set aggressive reconnect settings, but Telegram/Discord are more reliable long-term.

**Q: I already have OpenClaw but it's broken. Can you fix it?**
A: Absolutely. Message me with details and I'll scope a fix.

**Q: Do you offer ongoing support/maintenance?**
A: Yes — ask about my monthly support subscription for ongoing help, config updates, and priority troubleshooting.
