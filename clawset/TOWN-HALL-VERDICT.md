# 🏛️ Clawhatch Town Hall — Expert Panel Deliberation
**Pivot or Patch?**

*Six domain experts debate the strategic direction. A three-person jury delivers the verdict.*

## ⚖️ Jury Verdict
**Unanimous on direction, majority on sequencing**

### Patch with Security Integration — Execute Immediately

After deliberating on all four rounds, the jury has reached a unanimous conclusion on the strategic direction and a majority position on execution sequencing.

**On positioning (Round 1):** The jury sides with Dr. Vasquez's "conditional pivot" — reframe the promise as "trusted outcomes" (safe, personalised, maintained) rather than either a pure security pivot or the current setup-wizard-only positioning. The personalisation angle is a genuine differentiator that should not be abandoned (as Sarah Kim argued), but security must be elevated from implicit to explicit (as Prof. Chen demonstrated). The winning formulation is: **"Clawhatch gets you set up safely, makes it yours, and keeps it running."**

**On Lemon Squeezy compliance (Round 2):** The jury unanimously agrees with Judge Okonkwo — this is the highest-priority fix. Split payment rails before the first transaction. Use Lemon Squeezy for digital products only (config packages, templates, audit reports). Use Stripe or invoicing for anything involving human time (setup sessions, ongoing support). Tom Reeves's "reframe as deliverables" approach is a reasonable intermediate step but does not eliminate the risk.

**On pricing (Round 3):** The jury endorses Dr. Vasquez's founding-customer compromise. List prices at £149/£299/£499 with a 40-50% founding discount for the first 20 customers (effective: ~£79/£149/£249). This balances Dr. Hartwell's trust-signal argument with Tom Reeves's conversion-reality argument. The £29/month support subscription is correctly priced and should not change.

**On build sequencing (Round 4):** This was the most contested round. The jury's majority position is a hybrid of Tom Reeves's and Sarah Kim's arguments:

**Week 1:** Do 3-5 manual setups (free or deeply discounted). This is non-negotiable. No amount of specification replaces real customer contact. Simultaneously, publish the already-written Reddit content and activate the Fiverr listing.

**Week 2:** Execute the autonomous build sprint using the hybrid approach (v0.dev + Claude Code harness), building the wizard with embedded security baseline checks. The manual setup experience from Week 1 will inform which wizard steps need adjustment before the build.

**Week 3:** Launch the paid tiers at founding-customer pricing. Begin the content publication cadence.

Prof. Chen's audit-tool-first proposal was compelling but was judged as a Phase 2 product, not a Phase 1 priority. The audit tool should follow the wizard, not replace it, because the wizard serves the acquisition funnel while the audit tool serves an adjacent market (existing installations) that is better captured after Clawhatch has established credibility.
