## 1. Name Research

### 25 Name Candidates

| # | Name | Memorability | Relevance | Fun Factor | Domain Likely Available | Notes |
|---|------|:-----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|-------|
| 1 | **Clawhatch** | 5 | 5 | 4 | Y (.com/.io) | "Closet" pun — your setup toolkit closet. Already in use as project name. Strong. |
| 2 | **ShellSetup** | 3 | 4 | 2 | Y | Descriptive but generic. Shell = terminal + crustacean double meaning. |
| 3 | **PinchPoint** | 4 | 3 | 4 | N (likely taken) | Fun but sounds like a pain point, not a solution. |
| 4 | **ClawReady** | 4 | 5 | 3 | Y | Clear action: "your claw is ready." Solid. |
| 5 | **LobsterLaunch** | 4 | 4 | 5 | Y | Very fun, very memorable. Maybe too playful for dev tools. |
| 6 | **LaunchClaw** | 3 | 5 | 3 | Y | Direct, action-oriented. Forgettable though. |
| 7 | **SetClaw** | 3 | 5 | 2 | Y | Too close to "setclock." |
| 8 | **ClawUp** | 4 | 5 | 3 | Y | Like "level up" — nice energy. Short. |
| 9 | **SnapSetup** | 4 | 3 | 3 | N (snap is overused) | Clean but no claw connection. |
| 10 | **ReefReady** | 3 | 2 | 3 | Y | Ocean theme but too far from claw/lobster. |
| 11 | **ClawOps** | 3 | 4 | 2 | Y | Professional, DevOps-adjacent. Boring. |
| 12 | **Pinch** | 5 | 3 | 4 | N (.com taken) | Great standalone word. Lobster pinch = quick setup. |
| 13 | **Molt** | 5 | 3 | 4 | N (.com likely taken) | Lobsters molt to grow — great metaphor for upgrading/setup. |
| 14 | **Carapace** | 3 | 3 | 2 | Y | Too obscure / hard to spell. |
| 15 | **SnapClaw** | 4 | 5 | 4 | Y | Snap of a claw = instant setup. Strong candidate. |

| 17 | **ShellSnap** | 3 | 4 | 3 | Y | Shell + snap. Decent. |
| 18 | **Claunch** | 4 | 5 | 4 | Y | Claw + Launch portmanteau. Punchy. Unique. |
| 19 | **Hatch** | 5 | 4 | 3 | N (.com taken) | Eggs hatch, lobsters hatch. Setup = birth. Beautiful metaphor. |
| 20 | **ClawKit** | 4 | 5 | 3 | Y | Toolkit for your claw. Clear and useful. |
| 21 | **Snapper** | 4 | 4 | 4 | N (.com taken) | Snapping shrimp / snapping claw. Fast setup energy. |
| 22 | **Tideclaw** | 3 | 4 | 3 | Y | Tidal = deployment wave. Poetic. |
| 23 | **Clawstack** | 3 | 4 | 2 | Y | Stack = tech stack. Professional. |

| 25 | **Clawhatch** | 5 | 5 | 4 | Y | Listed again because it's genuinely the best option. |

### Top 5 Recommendations
1. **Clawhatch** — Already chosen, and it's excellent. Closet pun (toolkit), claw reference, easy to say, unique, likely available.
2. **SnapClaw** — If Clawhatch isn't available. Quick-snap energy.
3. **Claunch** — Bold portmanteau. Memorable.
4. **ClawUp** — Simple, action-oriented, "level up" energy.

## 2. Color Palette Research

### What Works by Audience

**Developer tools:** Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a to #1a1a2e), neon accents (cyan, purple, green), high contrast, monospace typography. Examples: Vercel (black/white), Railway (purple gradients), Linear (purple/blue).

**Consumer SaaS:** White/light backgrounds, saturated brand colors, rounded corners, warmth. Examples: Notion (warm white), Slack (purple/green).

**Setup/onboarding UX:** Green = success/complete, amber = in progress, blue = current step, gray = upcoming. Celebration moments use gold/confetti tones.

### Palette A: "Deep Shell" — Dark + Neon (Developer Crowd)

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Primary** | Electric Lobster Red | `#FF3B30` |
| **Secondary** | Deep Ocean | `#0D1B2A` |
| **Accent** | Bioluminescent Cyan | `#00E5FF` |
| **Success** | Reef Green | `#00C853` |
| **Warning** | Amber Shell | `#FFB300` |
| **Error** | Coral Red | `#FF1744` |
| **Background** | Abyss Black | `#0A0A0F` |
| **Surface** | Deep Slate | `#151520` |
| **Text** | Pearl White | `#F0F0F5` |
| **Text Muted** | Seafoam Gray | `#6B7280` |

### Palette B: "Sunny Reef" — Light + Vibrant (Approachable/Consumer)

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Primary** | Friendly Lobster | `#E8453C` |
| **Secondary** | Ocean Blue | `#2563EB` |
| **Accent** | Sunset Orange | `#F97316` |
| **Success** | Seagrass Green | `#22C55E` |
| **Warning** | Sandy Gold | `#EAB308` |
| **Error** | Coral Pink | `#EF4444` |
| **Background** | Sand White | `#FAFAF9` |
| **Surface** | Shell White | `#FFFFFF` |
| **Text** | Deep Navy | `#1E293B` |
| **Text Muted** | Driftwood | `#94A3B8` |

### Palette C: "Twilight Reef" — Hybrid (Dark with Friendly Pops) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Primary** | Warm Lobster Red | `#EF4444` |
| **Secondary** | Twilight Purple | `#7C3AED` |
| **Accent** | Electric Teal | `#14B8A6` |
| **Success** | Living Green | `#10B981` |
| **Warning** | Warm Amber | `#F59E0B` |
| **Error** | Hot Coral | `#F43F5E` |
| **Background** | Charcoal | `#111118` |
| **Surface** | Elevated Dark | `#1C1C27` |
| **Border** | Subtle Edge | `#2D2D3A` |
| **Text** | Soft White | `#E5E5EA` |
| **Text Muted** | Fog | `#71717A` |
| **Gradient** | Hero gradient | `linear-gradient(135deg, #7C3AED 0%, #EF4444 50%, #F59E0B 100%)` |

The hybrid palette works because:
- Dark enough to feel "developer-grade" and premium
- Lobster red is the hero brand color (ties to OpenClaw 🦞)
- Purple adds sophistication (Linear/Railway territory)
- Teal accent for interactive elements feels fresh
- The gradient can serve as a signature hero element

## 3. Logo Concepts

### Concept 1: "The Claw Mark"
- **Looks like:** Three curved slash marks (like claw scratches) forming a subtle "C" shape. Minimal, geometric.
- **Communicates:** Speed, power, precision. "We got this handled."
- **Style:** Flat icon, works at any size. Think Linear's mark or Stripe's "S."

### Concept 2: "The Lobster Setup"
- **Looks like:** A stylized lobster claw holding/gripping a gear or terminal cursor (▌). The claw is simplified to ~5 geometric shapes.
- **Communicates:** AI assistant that builds and configures. Friendly but capable.
- **Style:** Flat mascot-icon hybrid. Like GitHub's Octocat simplified to icon form.

### Concept 3: "Shell Bracket"
- **Looks like:** A lobster claw shape that doubles as code brackets `{ }` or angle brackets `< >`. The negative space between two claw pincers forms the bracket.
- **Communicates:** Code-native. Developer tool. Claw = code.
- **Style:** Geometric wordmark icon. Pairs with "Clawhatch" text.

### Concept 4: "The Snap"
- **Looks like:** Two claw pincers about to snap together, with a small spark/starburst at the contact point. Implies "snap and it's done."
- **Communicates:** Instant, effortless setup. One snap = configured.
- **Style:** Flat with a single accent color spark. Motion implied through the gap.

### Concept 5: "The Closet Door" ⭐ BEST FIT FOR "CLAWHATCH"
- **Looks like:** A slightly open door/cabinet silhouette with a lobster claw peeking out — or the door handle IS a claw. Plays on the closet/clawhatch pun directly.
- **Communicates:** "Open your Clawhatch" = open your toolkit. Whimsy + utility. Discovery, possibility.
- **Style:** Flat icon with subtle depth (door shadow). Works as app icon perfectly. Rounded, friendly.

### UI Patterns to Steal

| Pattern | Best Example | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Stepper with icons** | Stripe onboarding | Each step has a unique icon, completed steps get a green check |
| **Live terminal preview** | Vercel deploy | Users see real output streaming — builds trust |
| **Checklist sidebar** | Stripe, Notion | Always visible progress, non-blocking |
| **Auto-detection magic** | Railway, Vercel | "We detected Node.js" — feels smart |
| **Confetti on completion** | Vercel, GitHub | Dopamine hit. Users screenshot and share it |
| **Copy-to-clipboard** | Supabase, Stripe | One-click copy for keys, commands, URLs |
| **Dark mode default** | Linear, Warp | Developers expect it. Light mode as option. |
| **Animated progress ring** | Apple, Raycast | Circular progress feels more premium than bars |
| **Skeleton loading** | Linear, Vercel | Content shapes before data loads — feels fast |
| **Step transitions** | Typeform | Smooth slide/fade between steps, not hard cuts |

### Celebration Moments to Implement
1. **Confetti burst** — on final "Setup Complete" (use canvas-confetti library)
2. **Checkmark morph** — loading spinner morphs into checkmark (Lottie animation)
3. **Lobster emoji rain** — 🦞🦞🦞 falling animation (on-brand, delightful, shareable)
4. **Sound effect** — subtle "snap" sound on completion (optional, muted by default)
5. **Share card** — auto-generated "I just set up my AI assistant with Clawhatch" card

## 5. Typography

### Recommended Font Stack

| Role | Font | Weight | Why |
|------|------|--------|-----|
| **Headlines** | **Inter** (Bold/Black) | 700-900 | Already in OpenClaw ecosystem. Clean, geometric, scales beautifully. |
| **Body** | **Inter** (Regular/Medium) | 400-500 | Excellent readability. Familiar to developers. |
| **Code/Terminal** | **JetBrains Mono** | 400-700 | Already in ecosystem. Ligatures are chef's kiss. Industry standard. |
| **Accent/Branding** | **Space Grotesk** | 500-700 | For hero text, landing pages. More personality than Inter. Geometric but warm. |

### Why Not Change?
Inter + JetBrains Mono is already best-in-class. Vercel uses Geist (Inter-adjacent). Linear uses Inter. Don't fix what isn't broken. Add **Space Grotesk** as a personality layer for marketing/hero sections only.

### Type Scale (recommended)
```
xs:   12px / 0.75rem
sm:   14px / 0.875rem  
base: 16px / 1rem
lg:   18px / 1.125rem
xl:   20px / 1.25rem
2xl:  24px / 1.5rem
3xl:  30px / 1.875rem
4xl:  36px / 2.25rem
5xl:  48px / 3rem
hero: 64px / 4rem
```

## 6. Competitor Visual Audit

### Vercel
- **Colors:** Black, white, minimal. Almost no color — relies on layout and typography.
- **Vibe:** Premium, minimal, "we're serious engineers." Swiss design influence.
- **Logo:** Simple triangle/play button. Geometric.
- **Differentiator:** Extreme minimalism. White space as a design element.

### Railway
- **Colors:** Purple-heavy gradients, dark backgrounds, bright accents.
- **Vibe:** Fun, visual, "infrastructure should be beautiful." Younger energy.
- **Logo:** Stylized "R" mark. Purple-forward.
- **Differentiator:** Visual canvas metaphor. Infrastructure as art.

### Linear
- **Colors:** Purple-blue gradients on dark. Minimal but with color personality.
- **Vibe:** Fast, precise, opinionated. "We care about craft."
- **Logo:** Geometric lines forming an "L." Animated gradient fills.
- **Differentiator:** Speed as brand identity. Everything feels instant.

### Stripe
- **Colors:** Purple primary (#635BFF), vibrant gradients, light backgrounds.
- **Vibe:** Professional yet approachable. "Financial infrastructure, but make it friendly."
- **Logo:** Bold wordmark + gradient. Recognizable from a mile away.
- **Differentiator:** Best-in-class documentation design. Code + prose perfectly balanced.

### Visual Patterns This Audience Expects

1. **Dark mode by default** — Light mode exists but dark is home
2. **Gradient accents** — Not flat single-colors; subtle gradients on CTAs and highlights
3. **Generous spacing** — No cramped UIs. Breathing room everywhere.
4. **Blur/glass effects** — Frosted glass panels, blur backgrounds (macOS influence)
5. **Smooth animations** — 200-300ms transitions. Spring physics. Nothing jarring.
6. **Monospace moments** — Code snippets, terminal output, version numbers in mono
7. **Border radius: 8-12px** — Rounded but not bubbly. Not 0, not 24px.
8. **Subtle borders** — 1px borders in `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` on dark backgrounds
9. **Status colors** — Green = good, amber = warning, red = error (universal)
10. **Command palette** — Cmd+K is expected. Fast keyboard access to everything.

## Recommended Brand Direction

### Name: **Clawhatch**
It's perfect. Don't change it. The closet/toolkit pun is clever without being forced, the claw reference is obvious, it's unique, memorable, short, and has strong domain availability potential.

### Colors: **Palette C — "Twilight Reef"**
Dark hybrid with warm lobster red primary, twilight purple secondary, and electric teal accent. This positions Clawhatch as a premium developer tool (dark mode) that's friendlier than Vercel (color personality) and more focused than Railway (restrained palette).

### Logo: **Concept 5 — "The Closet Door"**
A slightly ajar door with a claw handle or claw peeking out. It's the only concept that directly leverages the "Clawhatch" name pun. It's whimsical enough to be memorable, simple enough to work as a favicon, and tells a story: "open your Clawhatch."

### Typography: **Inter + JetBrains Mono + Space Grotesk**
Stay in the OpenClaw ecosystem. Add Space Grotesk for hero/marketing personality.

### Overall Vibe
> "The setup wizard that feels like opening a treasure chest."

**Not** cold and minimal like Vercel. **Not** chaotic-fun like Railway. Instead: **warm, competent, delightful.** Like a well-organized toolkit that makes you smile when you open it. Think: Linear's craft + Stripe's approachability + a lobster emoji.

**Tagline candidates:**
- "Open your Clawhatch" (primary)
- "Setup, snapped." 
- "Your AI assistant toolkit"
- "Everything you need. One snap."
