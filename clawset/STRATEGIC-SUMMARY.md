# STRATEGIC SUMMARY
**Clawhatch Town Hall Verdict — Key Takeaways**

*Generated: 2026-02-03*

---

## The Verdict (TL;DR)

**Direction:** Patch with Security Integration (unanimous)  
**Positioning:** "Clawhatch gets you set up safely, makes it yours, and keeps it running."  
**Execution:** Manual setups (Week 1) → Wizard build (Week 2) → Launch (Week 3)  
**Pricing:** £149/£299/£499 list with 47-50% founding discount (first 20 customers)

---

## Three Strategic Pillars (The New Frame)

### 🛡️ Safe Baseline
Security elevated from implicit to explicit. Not just "it works" but "it works safely."
- Sandboxing enforced
- API keys encrypted
- Allowlists configured
- Security audit included (Enterprise+)

### 🎨 Personalised
Genuine differentiator. Not a generic template, built for your workflow.
- Tools you need, not a bloated feature set
- Channels you use
- Personality that fits your vibe (SOUL.md)
- Custom configs for your environment

### 🔧 Maintained
Ongoing support keeps it running. Setup is day one, maintenance is every day after.
- Proactive monitoring
- Config updates when OpenClaw evolves
- Support subscription (£29/mo)
- Never lose days to broken configs

## Critical Decisions

### 1. Payment Rails MUST Split Before First Sale
**Why:** Lemon Squeezy TOS prohibits services involving human time.  
**How:** Lemon Squeezy for digital products (Pro, Enterprise configs). Stripe for services (Concierge 1:1 sessions).  
**Priority:** P0 (highest, blocking)

### 2. Manual Setups Come First
**Why:** Customer discovery is non-negotiable. No amount of specification replaces real customer contact.  
**How:** 3-5 free/discounted setup sessions via Reddit + Fiverr + Calendly.  
**What We Get:** Testimonials, wizard UX insights, pricing validation.

### 3. Pricing: Trust Signals via Founding Discount
**Why:** £39/£79 pricing signals "toy project". £149/£299/£499 signals "professional service".  
**How:** List at £149/£299/£499, offer 47-50% founding discount for first 20 customers.  
**Result:** Perceived value high, acquisition cost low (founding = £79/£149/£249).

### 4. Wizard With Embedded Security, Not Security-First Audit Tool
**Why:** Wizard serves acquisition funnel (setup → paying customer). Audit tool serves adjacent market (existing installs).  
**How:** Build wizard with security checkpoints visible in UI (green badges, warnings).  
**Phase 2:** Standalone audit tool after wizard establishes credibility.

## What Changed vs Original Plan

| Original Plan | Town Hall Verdict | Reason |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Launch wizard first | Do manual setups first | Customer discovery beats speculation |
| £39 Pro pricing | £149 list (£79 founding) | Trust signal + margin for sustainability |
| Security implicit in wizard | Security explicit as pillar | Differentiation + compliance |
| Single payment rail (Lemon Squeezy) | Dual rails (LS + Stripe) | TOS compliance |
| Audit tool = Phase 1 | Audit tool = Phase 2 | Wizard is acquisition, audit is retention |

---

## Expert Influence Scoreboard (Who Won the Debate)

1. **Judge Okonkwo (9.5/10)** — Lemon Squeezy compliance adopted as P0
2. **Dr. Vasquez (9.1/10)** — Trusted-outcomes framing adopted as core positioning
3. **Tom Reeves (8.9/10)** — Manual-first sequencing + "ship first" ethos
4. **Dr. Hartwell (8.7/10)** — Trust-signal pricing via founding discount
5. **Prof. Chen (8.4/10)** — Security elevated to pillar, audit deferred to Phase 2
6. **Sarah Kim (8.2/10)** — Wizard-with-security approach adopted

---

## Execution Timeline

### Week 1: Customer Discovery + Content Activation
**Goal:** Talk to real users, publish existing content, set up infrastructure.

**Wed-Thu:**
- Execute 3-5 manual setup sessions
- Update pricing display (founding discount badges)

**Success:** 3+ testimonials, Reddit guide with 50+ upvotes, payment rails compliant

---

### Week 2: Wizard Build
**Goal:** Ship functional wizard with embedded security checks.

**Mon-Tue:**
- Define tech stack (Electron recommended)
- Generate UI mockups via v0.dev
- Implement wizard backend logic (10 steps)

**Wed-Thu:**
- Build security audit generator
- Package wizard for distribution

**Fri-Sun:**
- Integrate manual setup learnings
- Reclassify fabricated case studies as templates

**Success:** Wizard v0.1 works end-to-end, security audit report generates

---

### Week 3: Launch
**Goal:** Go live with paid tiers, get first customers.

**Mon-Tue:**
- Record YouTube setup walkthrough video

**Wed-Thu:**

- Monitor first sales (1hr response SLA)

**Fri-Sun:**
- Iterate based on feedback
- Promote YouTube video

**Success:** First paid customer, £500+ in sales, 5-10 customers total

---

## Go/No-Go Launch Criteria

**MUST HAVE (Blocking):**
- ✅ Payment rails split (Lemon Squeezy digital, Stripe services)
- ✅ 3+ manual setups completed with testimonials
- ✅ Wizard v0.1 functional (can complete setup end-to-end)
- ✅ Homepage messaging updated (Safe + Personalised + Maintained)

**NICE TO HAVE (Not Blocking):**
- ⚠️ YouTube video (can publish after launch)
- ⚠️ Referral programme (Month 2+)
- ⚠️ Audit tool (Phase 2 product)

**If MUST HAVE items not done:** Delay launch, don't ship broken.  
**If NICE TO HAVE items not done:** Ship anyway, iterate in public.

---

## Revenue Model (Updated)

### One-Time Sales (Acquisition)
- **Pro:** £149 (£79 founding) — Automated config package
- **Enterprise:** £299 (£149 founding) — Advanced configs + security audit PDF
- **Concierge:** £499 (£249 founding) — 1:1 setup session

### Recurring Revenue (Retention)
- **Support:** £29/mo — Proactive monitoring, config updates, troubleshooting

### Target Metrics
- **Month 1:** £500-1000 (5-10 founding customers)
- **Month 2:** £2,000 (20 founding customers claimed)
- **Month 6:** £5,000/mo (50 total customers + 20 subscriptions)

---

## What We're NOT Doing (Deferred to Phase 2+)

❌ **Standalone audit tool** (Phase 2, Month 2+)  
❌ **Referral programme** (After 10+ customers)  
❌ **Advanced automation features** (Focus on wizard simplicity first)  
❌ **Multi-language support** (English only for MVP)  
❌ **Enterprise SSO/compliance features** (Not needed for first 20 customers)

**Why:** Focus. Ship the wizard, get customers, iterate. Don't build features nobody asked for.

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Manual setups don't yield enough insights
**Mitigation:** Record every session, structured interview questions, detailed notes

### Risk: Wizard build takes >1 week
**Mitigation:** v0.dev for rapid UI, MVP feature set, hybrid approach (v0 + Claude Code)

### Risk: No sales in Week 3
**Mitigation:** Aggressive founding pricing (47-50% off), manual setup testimonials, multi-channel content (Reddit + Fiverr + YouTube)

### Risk: Lemon Squeezy compliance issue
**Mitigation:** P0.1 (split rails) is BEFORE first sale — non-negotiable

---

## Messaging Shift

### Old (Setup Wizard Focus)
❌ "Automated OpenClaw setup in 10 minutes"  
❌ "No more config file hell"  
❌ "Just click and go"

### New (Trusted Outcomes Focus)
✅ "Your OpenClaw agent, set up safely and built for you"  
✅ "Professional setup with security baked in"  
✅ "Safe baseline, personalised config, ongoing maintenance"

**Why:** "Automation" alone is a commodity. "Trusted outcomes" is a promise. Security + personalisation + maintenance = differentiated value.
