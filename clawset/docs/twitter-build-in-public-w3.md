## Notes for Rich

**Tone guidance:**
- No humble-bragging. If the numbers are bad, say they're bad.
- "Build in public" audiences reward honesty over polish.
- If revenue is $0, say $0. That's content too.
- Compare against your own targets from BUSINESS-PLAN.md, not vanity benchmarks.

**Targets from the plan (Month 1-3 conservative):**
- ~$357/week ($158 from Tier 2 + $199 from Tier 3)
- ~$1,428/month
- 2× Tier 2 + 1× Tier 3 per week

**Post timing:** Tuesday or Wednesday morning, 8-9am UK time. Thread format, not single tweet.
