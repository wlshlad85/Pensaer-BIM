> Goal: Scale freelancing revenue to £500+/month through strategic pricing, tiered services, and recurring revenue.

## 1. Price Increase Justification

### Why Higher Prices Are Warranted

**Market data supports it:**
- Fiverr AI/bot setup gigs: $50–500 across tiers (top sellers charge 2–5× more than newcomers)
- Upwork fixed-price bot/AI projects: $200–800 standard range
- Managed IT setup fees: $250–750 is considered **low end**
- The $200–500 range is the "impulse zone" for small business buyers — signals quality without requiring committee approval

**Positioning shift:**
- Below $100 signals "amateur" — above $200 signals "professional"
- Clients paying $50 for setup are the highest-maintenance, lowest-value customers
- Non-technical clients are **relieved** to find $200–500 services (vs. $2K+ agencies)
- Nobody complains about a plumber charging $200 for a 30-minute fix — **sell expertise, not time**

**Pricing psychology:**
- Odd-specific pricing ($69, $149, $249) signals "precisely calculated value" and outperforms round numbers
- The decoy effect: three tiers where the middle looks like the obvious choice
- Anchoring: showing Premium first makes Pro look reasonable

**Your justification to clients:**
> "My rates reflect the expertise, testing, and ongoing reliability you get. A $69 setup saves you 5–10 hours of troubleshooting. A $249 setup saves you weeks and includes documentation you can hand to anyone."

## 2. New Tier Structure

### 🟢 Basic — $69
**"Quick Setup"**
- Standard bot/AI assistant setup (1 platform)
- Pre-built configuration templates applied
- Basic testing & verification
- 48-hour delivery
- 3 days post-delivery support via messages
- **Target:** Budget-conscious clients, simple projects
- **Time investment:** ~1–1.5 hours

### 🔵 Pro — $149
**"Professional Setup" ← Recommended (highlight this tier)**
- Full custom setup & configuration
- Multi-platform or advanced integration
- Thorough testing & optimization
- Custom documentation/handover guide
- 7 days post-delivery support
- 1 revision round included
- 24-hour rush delivery available (+$50)
- **Target:** Small businesses, serious hobbyists
- **Time investment:** ~2–3 hours

### 🟣 Premium — $249+
**"Complete Solution"**
- Everything in Pro, plus:
- Full custom development/tailoring to specific needs
- Detailed technical documentation
- Server/hosting setup & configuration included
- 14 days post-delivery priority support
- 2 revision rounds included
- Screen-share handover walkthrough (30 min)
- **Target:** Businesses, non-technical clients wanting "just make it work"
- **Time investment:** ~3–5 hours
- **Pricing:** $249 base, scales to $349–499 for complex projects

### Tier Psychology
```
  $249+ Premium ← Anchors value, highest margin per hour
  $149  Pro     ← "Sweet spot" — most clients land here
  $69   Basic   ← Entry point, proves your quality
```

The $249 Premium makes $149 Pro look like a bargain. The $69 Basic gets price-sensitive clients in the door who may return for Pro-level work later.

## 3. Monthly Maintenance Upsell — $29/month

### "Peace of Mind" Support Package

**What's included:**
- Monthly health check & status report (proactive — visible value every month)
- Priority support via email/DMs (24-hour response guarantee)
- Configuration updates & tweaks (up to 2 per month)
- Monitoring & uptime checks
- 10% discount on any future setup/project work
- Early access to new service offerings

**Annual option:** $290/year (save $58 — 2 months free)

### Why $29/month Works
- Below the "ask my manager" threshold
- Above the "not worth it" threshold
- At the "Netflix price" — low enough nobody cancels reflexively
- 80–90% gross margin (most months, clients need nothing — they pay for the safety net)

### Churn Prevention Strategy
1. **Send a monthly report** every month without fail: "Updated X, checked Y, your system is healthy ✅"
2. **Proactive outreach** when relevant updates drop: "Version 2.5 is out — I've applied it to your setup"
3. **Frame cancellation as risk:** "Without ongoing support, you may miss critical updates"
4. **Push annual billing** — locks in revenue, reduces churn math dramatically

### Revenue Potential
| Active Subscribers | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 5 | £145/mo | £1,740/yr |
| 10 | £290/mo | £3,480/yr |
| 20 | £580/mo | £6,960/yr |

**Target: 10 maintenance subscribers within 3 months of launching the package = £290/mo recurring baseline.**

### When to Pitch
- **Right after successful delivery** — trust is highest, value is proven
- Include a note in every delivery: *"Want to keep everything running perfectly? My monthly maintenance plan is just $29/mo."*
- Follow up 7 days post-delivery: *"How's everything running? By the way, I offer ongoing support..."*
- Follow up 30 days post-delivery: *"Checking in — if anything needs adjusting, my maintenance clients get priority."*

## 4. Email Template to Past Clients

### Subject: Quick update + something new for you

---

Hi [Name],

Hope [project you did for them] is still running smoothly for you!

I'm reaching out because I've been levelling up my services based on feedback from clients like you, and I wanted to let you know about a couple of things:

**🔧 New: Monthly Maintenance Plan ($29/mo)**
A few clients asked if I could keep an eye on things after setup — so I'm now offering ongoing support:
- Monthly health checks & status reports
- Priority support (24hr response)
- Up to 2 config changes per month
- 10% off any future work

If you've been meaning to update or tweak anything from our original project, this is the easiest way to stay covered. **First month is on me** if you sign up this week.

**💡 Need anything else built?**
I've expanded into [mention 1-2 new service areas relevant to them]. If you or anyone you know needs help, I'd love to chat.

Either way, thanks again for working with me on [project]. Happy to help anytime.

Cheers,
[Your name]

P.S. — If you know someone who could use setup/config help, send them my way and I'll give you both 15% off your next project.

### Variations

**For clients whose project may need updates:**
> Subject: Is [project] still running well?
> Lead with: "It's been [X months] since we set up [thing]. A lot has changed since then — want me to do a quick check-up? Free of charge, no strings."
> Then pitch the maintenance plan as a natural next step.

**For clients you had a great rapport with:**
> Subject: Been a while — got something cool for you
> More casual tone, reference personal details, lead with value.

## 6. Revenue Projection — Path to £500+/Month

### Conservative Scenario (Month 1–3: Ramp-Up)

| Month | Basic ($69) | Pro ($149) | Premium ($249) | Maintenance ($29/mo) | Total |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | 2 = £138 | 1 = £149 | 0 | 0 | **£287** |
| 2 | 2 = £138 | 2 = £298 | 1 = £249 | 2 × £29 = £58 | **£743** |
| 3 | 3 = £207 | 2 = £298 | 1 = £249 | 4 × £29 = £116 | **£870** |

*£500/mo target hit by Month 2.*

### Moderate Scenario (Month 4–6: Established)

| Month | Basic | Pro | Premium | Maintenance (cumulative) | Total |
|-------|-------|-----|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| 4 | 3 = £207 | 3 = £447 | 1 = £249 | 6 × £29 = £174 | **£1,077** |
| 5 | 3 = £207 | 3 = £447 | 2 = £498 | 8 × £29 = £232 | **£1,384** |
| 6 | 4 = £276 | 4 = £596 | 2 = £498 | 10 × £29 = £290 | **£1,660** |

### Growth Scenario (Month 7–12: Scaling)

| Month | One-Time Revenue | Maintenance Subs | Maintenance Rev | Total |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| 9 | ~£1,200 | 15 | £435 | **£1,635** |
| 12 | ~£1,500 | 20 | £580 | **£2,080** |

### Revenue Breakdown at £500/mo Target
The simplest path to £500/month:
- **2 Pro orders** ($149 × 2 = £298) + **1 Basic** ($69 = £69) + **5 maintenance subs** (£145) = **£512/mo**
- That's just 3 new clients per month + a growing maintenance base

### Key Assumptions
- Prices shown in $ on platforms, converted to £ at ~1:1 for simplicity (actual rate favourable: $1 ≈ £0.79)
- So $149 ≈ £118 received — **actual GBP revenue will be ~20% higher than USD face value**
- Platform fees (Fiverr 20%, Upwork 10–20%) factored into projections at ~15% average cut
- Maintenance subscribers accumulate with ~10% monthly churn after month 3

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| First £500 month | Month 2 | 3–4 gig orders + maintenance launch |
| First £1,000 month | Month 4 | 5–7 orders + 6 maintenance subs |
| £1,500/month steady | Month 6–8 | 8–10 orders + 10 subs |
| £2,000/month | Month 10–12 | 10+ orders + 15–20 subs |

- [ ] Optimize gig images and descriptions per Section 5

### Ongoing
- [ ] Pitch maintenance to every completed client (at delivery + 7 days + 30 days)

*This plan is designed to be realistic and actionable. The £500/mo target is conservative and achievable within 2 months with consistent effort. The real unlock is maintenance subscriptions — they compound monthly and create a revenue floor that grows even when new orders are slow.*
