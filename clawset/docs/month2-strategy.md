# Clawhatch — Month 2 Strategy
## March 2025

> **North Star:** Double Month 1 revenue. Expand distribution. Operationalise support. Take one big swing.

---

## 1. Revenue Target

| Metric | Month 1 Target | Month 2 Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Revenue | ~$500 | **$1,000** |
| Pro Setups ($39) | ~13 | 20 |
| Support Subs ($19/mo) | ~5 | 12 (+7 new) |
| Concierge ($79) | 1-2 | 4 |
| Affiliate income | ~$25 | $75 |

**Revenue breakdown target:**
- Pro Setup: 20 × $39 = $780
- Support Subs: 12 × $19 = $228 (5 retained + 7 new)
- Concierge: 4 × $79 = $316
- Affiliates: ~$75
- **Total target: ~$1,400** (stretch) / **$1,000** (floor)

---

## 2. Pricing Adjustments Plan

### Test & Learn
- **A/B test Pro at $39 vs $49** — use Lemon Squeezy's variant feature or a simple URL split. Run for 2 weeks, measure conversion rate not just revenue.
- **Introduce $49/mo Priority Support tier** — for power users who want faster response (<4h) and monthly health checks. Positions $19/mo as "standard" by contrast.
- **Bundle deal: Pro + 3 months support = $89** (saves $18) — increases LTV, reduces churn decision points.
- **Concierge price hold at $79** — too early to raise. Focus on volume and testimonials first.

### Decision Points
- End of Week 2: Review A/B data. If $49 converts within 80% of $39 rate → switch permanently.
- End of Month: If concierge demand > 6/week → raise to $99 in Month 3.

---

## 4. New Channels to Test

### Indie Hackers
- **Week 2:** Launch "milestone" post — "From idea to revenue in 4 weeks"
- **Ongoing:** Comment on related product posts, build relationships
- **Goal:** 3-5 wizard signups from IH by end of month
- **Metric:** Track via UTM `?ref=indiehackers`

### Hacker News
- **Week 3:** "Show HN" post — focus on the technical automation angle, not the business pitch
- **Approach:** Lead with the open-source config generator. HN hates marketing, loves tools.
- **Goal:** Front page = bonus. 50+ upvotes = success. Any traffic = worth it.
- **Metric:** UTM `?ref=hackernews`

### Newsletter Sponsorships / Swaps
- **Target newsletters:** TLDR, Console.dev, Developer Weekly, AI Tool Report
- **Week 1:** Research rates and pitch 2-3 newsletters for sponsored mentions ($50-150 range)
- **Week 3:** Offer newsletter swap with smaller AI/dev tool newsletters
- **Goal:** 1 paid placement, 1 swap by end of month
- **Budget:** Up to $200 for newsletter ads (test ROI)

### Other Channels to Monitor
- **Product Hunt:** Save for Month 3 when wizard is more polished
- **Dev.to / Hashnode:** Cross-post SEO articles for backlinks
- **Discord communities:** AI and self-hosting servers — be helpful, not salesy

## 6. Big Swing: The OpenClaw Health Dashboard

### What
A free, open-source web tool: **paste your `openclaw.json`** (or run a local CLI command) and get a visual health report:
- ✅ Config validation (missing fields, deprecated options)
- 🔒 Security score (API key exposure, permissions audit)
- ⚡ Performance suggestions (model selection, token limits)
- 📊 Comparison against best practices
- 🔗 One-click "fix this" links back to Clawhatch wizard

### Why This Is the Big Swing
- **Viral potential:** Devs love sharing scores ("I got 95/100 on my OpenClaw health check")
- **SEO magnet:** "OpenClaw config checker" / "OpenClaw security audit" — own these searches
- **Funnel driver:** Every health check is a chance to upsell wizard, support, concierge
- **Community goodwill:** It's free and genuinely useful — builds trust before the ask
- **Defensible:** Hard to replicate quickly; compounds with every new check we add

### Execution
- **Week 1-2:** Build MVP (client-side JSON parser + 15 checks)
- **Week 3:** Launch on HN alongside Show HN post
- **Week 4:** Iterate based on feedback, add 10 more checks

### Success Metrics
- 100+ health checks run in first 2 weeks
- 10% click-through to wizard from health check results
- 5+ backlinks from dev blogs/forums

## 7. Support Tier Operationalisation

### Standard Support ($19/mo)
**SLA & Process:**
- Response time: <24 hours (business days)
- Channel: Dedicated Discord channel per subscriber (or WhatsApp group)
- Scope: Config issues, troubleshooting, update guidance
- Exclusions: Custom development, new feature requests

**Tooling:**
- Intake: Subscriber sends message → tagged in support queue
- First response: OpenClaw assistant handles L1 (FAQ-based auto-reply)
- Escalation: If assistant can't resolve → Rich notified within 4 hours
- Resolution: Fix applied or workaround provided with documentation

**Monthly Deliverables:**
- Health check report (automated via CLI)
- "What's new" summary of OpenClaw updates
- Proactive config update if breaking changes detected

### Priority Support ($49/mo) — NEW
**SLA & Process:**
- Response time: <4 hours
- Channel: Direct WhatsApp + Discord
- Scope: Everything in Standard + priority escalation + monthly 15-min check-in call
- Includes: Proactive security patches applied

### Operational Setup
- [ ] Create support response template library (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up Discord support channels with role-based access
- [ ] Build automated health check script (runs monthly, emails report)
- [ ] Create escalation flowchart: L1 (bot) → L2 (async Rich) → L3 (call)
- [ ] Track support tickets in simple Notion/kanban board
- [ ] Set up cron job for monthly health check reminders

### Churn Prevention
- **Day 7:** Check-in message ("How's everything running?")

## Budget

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Newsletter sponsorship | $200 | Test 1-2 placements |
| Domain/hosting | $0 | Already on Vercel free tier |
| Tools (Buttondown, etc.) | $0 | Free tiers sufficient |
| Video editing | $0 | Self-recorded, minimal editing |
| **Total Month 2 budget** | **$200** | Funded from Month 1 revenue |

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| HN post flops | Low traffic spike | Not dependent on HN; organic SEO is primary |
| $49 price kills conversion | Revenue miss | A/B test first; revert quickly if needed |
| Support overwhelm | Quality drop | Templates + L1 bot handle 80%; cap subscribers if needed |
| Clawhatch retaliates | Competition | We're faster, cheaper, automated. Moat deepens monthly. |
| Low Month 1 base to 2x | Target miss | Floor target ($1,000) is achievable even with modest Month 1 |

*Month 2 is about proving the model scales. Month 1 was "can we get a dollar?" Month 2 is "can we get a system?"*
