# Clawhatch Demo — YouTube Short Script (45s)

> **Format:** 9:16 vertical | **Duration:** 45 seconds | **Target:** Developers curious about self-hosted AI assistants

---

## 🎵 Background Music Mood
Upbeat lo-fi electronic — think "tech unboxing energy." Builds subtly from calm to satisfying drop at 35s (the magic moment). No lyrics. Reference vibe: Lakey Inspired – "Better Days" but faster.

## 0–3s | THE HOOK

**Screen:** Speaker direct-to-camera (or screen recording with face cam bubble)

**Audio/VO:**
> "OpenClaw running on your phone… in 10 minutes?"

**Text Overlay:**
```
🤯 AI assistant on your PHONE
      in 10 minutes?
```
*Big bold white text, slight zoom-in animation*

**SFX:** Subtle "whoosh" on text appear

## 3–15s | THE WIZARD

**Screen:** Screen recording of Clawhatch wizard launching in browser

**Audio/VO:**
> "Clawhatch is a setup wizard that gets you from zero to a fully working AI assistant — no terminal, no YAML files, just click through."

**Text Overlays** (appear sequentially, 3s each):
- `Step 1: Pick your AI provider` — show model selector (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
- `Step 2: Connect your channels` — show Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp toggles
- `Step 3: Name your assistant` — show the name + personality fields

**Visual:** Cursor clicks through each step smoothly. Highlight active panel with subtle glow/zoom.

## 15–35s | THE SPEED-RUN

**Screen:** Sped-up screen recording (2–3× speed) of completing setup

**Audio/VO:**
> "API key — paste. Discord bot token — paste. Pick a voice, pick a vibe, and… deploy."

**Text Overlays** (quick-cut style, 2s each):
- `✅ API Key` — *swoosh in*
- `✅ Discord connected` — *swoosh in*
- `✅ Telegram connected` — *swoosh in*
- `✅ Phone paired` — *swoosh in*
- `🚀 Deploying...` — *pulse animation*

**Visual at ~30s:** Terminal/progress bar showing services starting. Green checkmarks cascading.

**Text Overlay (big, centered):**
```
✅ LIVE
```

**SFX:** Satisfying "ding" on each checkmark. Bigger chime on LIVE.

## 35–45s | THE MAGIC MOMENT ✨

**Screen:** Split — phone screen on left, chat response on right

**Audio/VO:**
> "And now…"

**Visual sequence:**
1. **(35–38s)** Phone notification slides down: **"Hey, what's the weather today?"**
2. **(38–42s)** AI responds in real-time on phone: **"It's 18°C and sunny in London — perfect for a walk 🌤️"**
3. **(42–45s)** Zoom out to show the full setup — browser wizard + phone + chat all working together

**Text Overlay (final frame):**
```
