### 1/10 — THE HOOK

I spent 30 days building an OpenClaw setup business. Here are ALL the numbers 🧵

No fluff. No "6-figure framework." Just a guy who saw a $99/setup service, thought "I can automate that," and actually tried.

Here's what happened 👇

### 2/10 — REVENUE BREAKDOWN

💰 Month 1 Revenue:

- Tier 1 (Self-Service, $29): [X] sales → $[AMOUNT]
- Tier 2 (Concierge, $79): [X] sales → $[AMOUNT]
- Tier 3 (White Glove, $199): [X] sales → $[AMOUNT]
- Tier 4 (Business, $499): [X] sales → $[AMOUNT]

**Total Revenue: $[TOTAL]**

Target was $1,428/mo (conservative plan). Hit [X]% of that.

[If $0: "Zero. Absolutely nothing. Keep reading — this is where it gets interesting."]

### 3/10 — EXPENSES

🧾 What it cost to run this:

- Domain/hosting: $[X]
- Stripe fees: $[X]
- Software/tools: $[X]
- Paid ads (if any): $[X]
- Time invested: [X] hours
- If I valued my time at $30/hr: $[X]

**Total hard costs: $[TOTAL]**
**Total including time: $[TOTAL]**

**Net profit (real): $[REVENUE - HARD COSTS]**
**Net profit (honest, inc. time): $[REVENUE - ALL COSTS]**

[If negative: Own it. "I paid myself -$X/hr to learn. Still cheaper than an MBA."]

### 4/10 — CONTENT METRICS

📊 What I put out there:

- Tweets/posts: [X]
- Impressions: [X]
- Profile visits: [X]
- Link clicks to landing page: [X]
- YouTube/video views (if any): [X]

[Be specific. Vanity metrics are fine here — they show effort even if conversions sucked.]

### 5/10 — CONVERSION RATES

🔄 The funnel, naked:

- Landing page visitors: [X]
- Signed up / showed interest: [X] → [X]% conversion
- Reached checkout: [X] → [X]% of visitors
- Actually paid: [X] → [X]% of visitors
- Completed onboarding: [X] → [X]% of paid

**Visitor → Paid Customer: [X]%**

[Industry avg for cold traffic is 1-3%. If you're below that, say why. If above, don't get cocky — sample size is tiny.]

---

### 6/10 — CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST

🎯 What each customer actually cost me:

- Total marketing spend: $[X]
- Total hours on marketing: [X]h
- Customers acquired: [X]

**CAC (hard costs only): $[SPEND ÷ CUSTOMERS]**
**CAC (including time @ $30/hr): $[TOTAL ÷ CUSTOMERS]**

[If 0 customers: "CAC is infinity. Literally undefined. Can't divide by zero. Moving on."]

Target LTV needs to be 3x CAC minimum. Current trajectory: [viable / not yet / who knows]

### 7/10 — WHAT WORKED (Top 3)

✅ Things I'd double down on:

1. **[THING]** — [1-2 sentences on why it worked and the evidence]
2. **[THING]** — [1-2 sentences]
3. **[THING]** — [1-2 sentences]

[Examples to consider: automated wizard saving time, async delivery model, specific content that drove traffic, a particular channel, word of mouth, undercutting competitor pricing, the quality checklist differentiator]

---

### 8/10 — WHAT FAILED (Top 3)

❌ Things I'm killing or changing:

1. **[THING]** — [What happened, why it failed, how much time/money it wasted]
2. **[THING]** — [Same]
3. **[THING]** — [Same]

[Be brutal. Possible failures: nobody searched for the service, Zoom-free model confused people, pricing too low to signal quality, landing page didn't convert, wrong audience, built features nobody asked for, spent too long building and not enough selling]

---

### 9/10 — THE KEY LESSON

🧠 One thing I know now that I didn't 30 days ago:

"[One honest sentence. Not a platitude. Not 'just ship it bro.' Something specific you learned about THIS market, THIS customer, THIS business.]"

[Examples of good lessons:
- "People paying $99 for a Zoom setup aren't buying tech help — they're buying confidence. My automation removed the human and the confidence went with it."
- "The OpenClaw community is too small right now. There aren't enough people who need this service to sustain a business yet."
- "Async delivery is 10x more efficient but 10x harder to sell. People want to SEE someone helping them."
- "I underestimated how much trust matters when you're touching someone's computer remotely."]

- Revenue target: $[X] (was $1,428, adjusting to $[X] based on reality)
- Customers target: [X]
- Key bet: [The ONE thing you're changing that should have the biggest impact]
- Kill: [The ONE thing you're stopping]

If this helped, RT tweet 1. If it bombed, quote tweet with roasts. I deserve it either way.

## POSTING NOTES

- **Schedule:** Post tweet 1 at 8-9am EST (lunch UK). Reply-chain the rest with 2-3 min gaps.
- **Format:** Each tweet must be <280 chars. The above are drafts — trim ruthlessly before posting.
- **Images:** Attach a screenshot of your Stripe dashboard (or a $0 dashboard — honesty is the brand).
- **Engagement:** Reply to EVERY quote tweet and reply for the first 2 hours.
- **Cross-post:** Thread to LinkedIn (text post), Reddit r/SideProject and r/EntrepreneurRideAlong.
- **If revenue is $0:** Post it anyway. "Month 1: $0 revenue" threads consistently outperform success stories because people respect the honesty and root for the underdog.
