## 🎬 HOOK — Cold Open (0:00–0:40)

**[VISUAL]** Quick-cut montage: terminal commands flying, automations triggering, notifications pinging, files organizing themselves.

**[VOICEOVER]**
> "The number one OpenClaw skill in 2026 isn't coding. It isn't prompt engineering. It's something most people completely ignore — and by the end of this video, you'll have all ten skills ranked, demoed, and ready to set up yourself. Let's go."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** "#1 will surprise you" — pulsing, bottom-third

**[TRANSITION]** Glitch-wipe to title card: "TOP 10 OPENCLAW SKILLS — 2026"

## #10 — Custom TTS & Voice Pipelines

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- Number "10" smashes onto screen with bass thud
- Subtitle fades in: **"Custom TTS & Voice Pipelines"**
- Icon: 🎙️ waveform animation
- Background: dark with subtle sound-wave ripple

### Live Demo (30s)
Show OpenClaw triggering a TTS skill that reads a daily briefing aloud through connected speakers. Walk through the config: voice provider selection, speaker routing, and fallback chains. Demonstrate switching voices mid-pipeline and routing output to different rooms.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐ (Easy) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~15 minutes |
| Prerequisites | TTS provider API key, audio output device |

**[TRANSITION]** Waveform morphs into the number 9

## #9 — Smart File Organization

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "9" drops in with a filing-cabinet slam sound
- Subtitle: **"Smart File Organization"**
- Icon: 📁 folders sorting themselves animation

### Live Demo (30s)
Demo a skill that watches a downloads folder, auto-categorizes files by type and project, renames them with consistent conventions, and moves them to the right directory. Show it handling a messy dump of 20+ files in real time — PDFs to docs, images to assets, code to repos.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐ (Beginner) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~10 minutes |
| Prerequisites | File system access, watch directory configured |

**[TRANSITION]** Folders fly off screen, number 8 assembles from scattered files

---

## #8 — Multi-Node Device Control

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "8" forms from connected dots/nodes
- Subtitle: **"Multi-Node Device Control"**
- Icon: 🖥️📱 devices linking together

### Live Demo (30s)
Show OpenClaw paired with multiple nodes — a phone, a laptop, a desktop. Trigger a camera snap from the phone, grab a screenshot from the laptop, and run a command on the desktop — all from one chat interface. Highlight the pairing flow and how node discovery works.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~25 minutes per node |
| Prerequisites | Clawdbot node agent on each device |

**[TRANSITION]** Devices orbit and collapse into the number 7

- "7" pulses like a heartbeat monitor
- Subtitle: **"Proactive Heartbeat Automation"**
- Icon: 💓 ECG line animation

### Live Demo (30s)
Show the heartbeat system checking email, calendar, and weather on a rotation — without being asked. Demo the `HEARTBEAT.md` config, the state tracker in `heartbeat-state.json`, and a real notification arriving: "You have a meeting in 90 minutes and it's going to rain — grab an umbrella."

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐ (Easy) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~20 minutes |
| Prerequisites | Heartbeat interval configured, integrations connected |

**[TRANSITION]** Heartbeat flatlines → restarts as the number 6

---

## #6 — Browser Automation & Scraping

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "6" rendered as a browser tab
- Subtitle: **"Browser Automation & Scraping"**
- Icon: 🌐 browser window with robotic cursor

### Live Demo (30s)
Open a browser via OpenClaw, navigate to a site, extract structured data from a table, and save it as JSON — all through natural language. Then show the Chrome extension relay: attaching to an existing tab and interacting with a logged-in session without re-authenticating.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~15 minutes |
| Prerequisites | Browser profile configured, Chrome extension for relay mode |

**[TRANSITION]** Browser window minimizes into the number 5

---

## #5 — Cron & Scheduled Tasks

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "5" built from clock hands
- Subtitle: **"Cron & Scheduled Tasks"**
- Icon: ⏰ clock with gears turning

### Live Demo (30s)
Set up three cron jobs live: a Monday morning weekly summary, a daily git backup at midnight, and a 20-minute reminder. Show the cron config, demonstrate a job firing, and explain when to use cron vs heartbeat (exact timing vs batched checks).

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐ (Easy) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~10 minutes |
| Prerequisites | Cron system enabled in gateway config |

**[TRANSITION]** Clock hands spin rapidly → freeze on number 4

---

## #4 — Cross-Platform Messaging

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "4" assembled from chat bubbles (Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram icons)
- Subtitle: **"Cross-Platform Messaging"**
- Icon: 💬 multi-platform chat stack

### Live Demo (30s)
Send one message and have it arrive on Discord, WhatsApp, and a webhook — all from OpenClaw. Show the broadcast action, per-platform formatting (no markdown tables on WhatsApp, link suppression on Discord), and how to route replies back into a unified thread.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~30 minutes (per platform) |
| Prerequisites | Channel plugins configured for each platform |

**[TRANSITION]** Chat bubbles scatter → reform as the number 3

---

## #3 — Persistent Memory & Context

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "3" materializes like data loading from disk
- Subtitle: **"Persistent Memory & Context"**
- Icon: 🧠 brain with save-icon overlay

### Live Demo (30s)
Start a fresh session. Show OpenClaw reading `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, daily memory files, and `MEMORY.md` — reconstructing full context in seconds. Then make a decision, save a lesson to memory, and restart the session to prove it persists. Show the daily→long-term memory curation flow.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐ (Easy) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~20 minutes (initial structure) |
| Prerequisites | Workspace with memory directory and core .md files |

**[TRANSITION]** Brain pulses → data streams converge into the number 2

---

## #2 — Subagent Delegation

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "2" formed by two agents high-fiving
- Subtitle: **"Subagent Delegation"**
- Icon: 🤖🤖 two bots with a task arrow between them

### Live Demo (30s)
Trigger a complex task — "research, draft, and format a report." Show the main agent spawning a subagent, the subagent working independently (reading files, searching the web, writing output), and the result flowing back. Highlight that the main agent stays free for other conversations while the subagent works.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~5 minutes (built-in) |
| Prerequisites | Understanding of session architecture, task scoping |

**[TRANSITION]** Two agents merge → dramatic pause → screen goes dark

---

## #1 — Agentic Workspace Design

### Intro Graphic (5s)
- "1" descends with gold particle effects and triumphant music sting
- Subtitle: **"Agentic Workspace Design"**
- Icon: 🏗️ blueprint/architecture diagram coming to life

### Live Demo (30s)
This is the meta-skill. Show a workspace built from scratch: `AGENTS.md` defining behavior, `SOUL.md` defining personality, `TOOLS.md` for environment specifics, memory structure for continuity, heartbeat config for proactivity, and skill folders for capabilities. The point: *the workspace IS the product*. A well-designed workspace means every other skill on this list works better.

### Difficulty & Setup
| Difficulty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Expert — ongoing) |
|---|---|
| Setup Time | ~1 hour initial, then continuous refinement |
| Prerequisites | All previous skills understood; clear vision of what you want your agent to be |

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** "Your workspace is your agent's DNA."

## 🎬 OUTRO (30s)

**[VOICEOVER]**
> "That's the list. Ten skills, ten demos, and the one thing that ties them all together: your workspace design is the skill. It's not about memorizing commands — it's about building a system that thinks with you. Drop a comment with which skill you're setting up first, and if this helped, hit subscribe — I'm going deep on each of these in dedicated tutorials. See you in the next one."
