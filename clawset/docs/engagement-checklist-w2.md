---

## 1. Daily Twitter Routine (30–45 min/day)

### Morning Sweep (15 min)
Search these terms and reply to 3–5 relevant posts:

**High-intent (reply immediately):**
- `openclaw setup`
- `openclaw not working`
- `openclaw error`
- `clawdbot help`
- `openclaw API key`
- `openclaw gateway`
- `openclaw config`
- `"self-hosted AI assistant" help`

**Discovery (engage conversationally):**
- `self-hosted AI assistant`
- `run claude locally`
- `whatsapp AI bot`
- `telegram AI bot`
- `AI assistant setup`
- `local LLM assistant`

### Reply Templates

**Template A — Direct help (someone stuck):**
```
Had the same issue! The fix is usually [one-liner].

We put together a walkthrough that covers this: [link]

Happy to help if you hit anything else 🦞
```

**Template B — Discovery (someone exploring options):**
```
If you're looking at self-hosted options, OpenClaw is worth checking out — runs Claude/GPT on your own machine with WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord.

We built setup guides at clawhatch.com if you want the quick path.
```

**Template C — Empathy + expertise:**
```
Yeah, the config side of [tool] can be rough. We've been documenting the sharp edges — wrote up the most common gotchas here: [link]

What part are you stuck on?
```

### Afternoon Engagement (15 min)
- [ ] Like/reply to 5 posts from accounts in the OpenClaw/AI-tools space
- [ ] Quote-tweet or reply to 1 relevant thread with genuine insight
- [ ] Reply to any DMs or mentions from the morning

### Daily Targets
| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Searches performed | 8–10 terms |
| Replies sent | 5–8 |
| Likes given | 10–15 |
| Quote tweets | 1 |
| DMs answered | All (same day) |

## 2. Reddit Engagement Plan

### Subreddits to Monitor Daily
| Subreddit | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|
| r/selfhosted | 🔴 High | Core audience — people running their own infra |
| r/LocalLLaMA | 🔴 High | LLM enthusiasts, many want assistant setups |
| r/ChatGPT | 🟡 Medium | Huge reach, occasional setup questions |
| r/artificial | 🟡 Medium | Broader AI discussion, brand awareness |
| r/homelab | 🟡 Medium | Overlapping audience with self-hosted |
| r/node | 🟢 Low | Technical users who'd appreciate the stack |

### Thread Prioritisation (reply to these first)
1. **"Help me" posts** — anyone struggling with AI assistant setup, API config, self-hosting
2. **"What should I use?" posts** — recommendation threads for AI tools/assistants
3. **"I built this" posts** — congratulate, share tips, build relationships
4. **Cost/comparison threads** — drop the cost breakdown post angle (reference `reddit-cost-post.md`)

### Weekly Reddit Targets
- [ ] **2 helpful comments** per day in target subs (14/week)
- [ ] **1 original post** mid-week (tutorial, guide, or discussion starter)
- [ ] **0 self-promotion without value** — every comment must help first, link second
- [ ] Build karma in r/selfhosted and r/LocalLLaMA before posting links

### Reddit Rules
- Never link clawhatch.com in your first comment on a sub. Help first.
- 10:1 ratio — 10 helpful comments for every 1 that mentions Clawhatch
- If someone asks "what do you use?", that's a natural mention. Take it.

## 5. Escalation Triggers — Free Help vs Paid

### Always Free ✅
- Answering setup questions in public threads
- Sharing links to existing guides
- Quick troubleshooting (< 5 min of back-and-forth)
- Pointing someone to the right docs
- General advice on architecture/approach

### Offer Paid When 💰
These signals mean someone has a real problem worth paying to solve:

| Trigger | Response |
|---|---|
| **"I've been stuck for days"** | "Happy to jump on a quick call and sort this out — DM me if you want help" |
| **"I need this for my business/team"** | "We do setup packages for teams — want me to send details?" |
| **Custom integration request** (WhatsApp + CRM, multi-user, etc.) | "That's doable but needs custom work. Want to chat about scope?" |
| **"Can someone just do this for me?"** | "Yeah, we do exactly that. Here's what's included: [link to services]" |
| **Repeated back-and-forth (>3 exchanges)** without resolution | "This might be easier to sort out live — we offer 1:1 setup sessions" |
| **Enterprise/compliance questions** | "Let me put together something specific for your setup" |

### Escalation Script
```
Phase 1: Help freely and completely. Solve their problem.
Phase 2: If they need more → "Happy to help further, DM me"
Phase 3: In DM → Diagnose scope. If it's quick, just do it (goodwill).
Phase 4: If it's real work → "I can get this sorted for you. Here's what I'd suggest..."
```

### Hard Rules
- **Never bait-and-switch.** If you started helping for free, finish that specific issue for free.
- **Never withhold info** to force a sale. The free help IS the marketing.
- **Paid = speed + done-for-you.** Free = self-serve with guidance.
- The moment someone says "business" or "team" or "client" — that's a paid conversation.
