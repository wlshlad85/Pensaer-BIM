## 1) 🪝 HOOK (0:00–0:45)

**[COLD OPEN — Screen recording of a Claude API dashboard showing a bill]**

> "Three hundred and forty-seven dollars. That's what I spent last month running my AI assistant. And you know what? I'd pay it again tomorrow. But six months ago? I was spending TWELVE dollars for basically the same thing. The difference? I had no idea what I was doing."

**[Cut to talking head]**

> "If you've looked into running your own AI setup — whether that's Clawdbot, a custom Claude integration, or any agentic AI system — you've probably seen people say 'oh it's basically free' or 'it costs thousands.' Both are wrong. Today I'm breaking down every single cost, hidden and obvious, so you know EXACTLY what you're signing up for before you spend a penny."

**[Title card animation: "OpenClaw: How Much Does It REALLY Cost in 2026?"]**

> "And stick around to section six, because I'll show you how I cut my costs by 60% without losing any functionality."

---

## 2) 💰 API COSTS BREAKDOWN (0:45–3:30)

**[VISUAL: Animated pricing table building on screen]**

> "Let's start with the big one. The API. This is where most of your money goes, and it's also where most people get confused."

> "As of early 2026, here's what Anthropic charges for Claude API access:"

**[ON-SCREEN TABLE — build line by line]**

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Best For |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 | Quick tasks, routing |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | Daily driver, coding |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $15.00 | $75.00 | Complex reasoning, agentic work |

> "Now those numbers mean nothing without context. Let me translate."

**[VISUAL: Bar chart — "What 1 million tokens actually looks like"]**

> "One million tokens is roughly 750,000 words. That's about ten full novels. So if you're just chatting with Claude a few times a day, you're looking at maybe 50,000 tokens — which on Sonnet costs you... fifteen cents. A day."

> "But here's where it gets spicy. If you're running an AGENTIC setup — where Claude is reading files, writing code, browsing the web, managing your calendar — token usage EXPLODES. My Clawdbot setup regularly burns through 500K to 2 million tokens per day on a busy day. That's Opus-level reasoning, tool calls, context windows packed full."

**[VISUAL: Animated calculator showing daily cost building up]**

> "At Opus rates, 2 million tokens of input and 500K of output in a day? That's thirty dollars. In a single day. Times thirty? You're looking at potentially $600-900 a month if you're going full send."

> "But most people won't do that. Let me show you the realistic tiers in section five."

## 3) ⚖️ PRO vs MAX COMPARISON (3:30–6:00)

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison card]**

> "Now, Anthropic also offers subscription plans. And this is where it gets interesting, because for a lot of people, a subscription is actually CHEAPER than API access."

**[ON-SCREEN COMPARISON — animated build]**

| Feature | Claude Pro ($20/mo) | Claude Max ($100/mo) | Claude Max+ ($200/mo) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Usage limits | ~45 msgs/5hr (Opus) | 5x Pro limits | 20x Pro limits |
| API access | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Agentic use | Limited | Better | Best (subscription) |
| Extended thinking | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Priority access | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

> "Critical distinction: Pro and Max are for the CHAT INTERFACE. If you want to run Clawdbot, custom integrations, or any programmatic access, you need the API. They're separate products."

> "So who should use what?"

**[VISUAL: Decision flowchart]**

> "If you just want Claude for personal chat and occasional heavy thinking — Pro at twenty bucks is unbeatable. You cannot replicate that value via the API."

> "If you're a power user hitting limits constantly — Max at a hundred removes most friction."

> "If you want to BUILD things, run agents, integrate with your own systems — API is the only option. And that's a fundamentally different cost structure."

**[VISUAL: Venn diagram — "Chat Users" vs "Builder/Agent Users" with small overlap]**

> "The mistake I see most people make? They sign up for Max thinking it'll power their automations. It won't. You need API credits for that. And THAT is the hidden cost nobody mentions in the thumbnail."

## 4) 🕵️ HIDDEN COSTS (6:00–8:00)

**[VISUAL: Iceberg graphic — "What you SEE" above water, "What you DON'T" below]**

> "Alright, let's talk about the costs that don't show up on any pricing page."

**[Each item animates onto the iceberg below the waterline]**

> "**Number one: Compute.** You need something to RUN your setup on. Clawdbot, for example, needs a machine that's on 24/7 if you want always-on functionality. That's either your own PC — which costs electricity — or a VPS."

**[ON-SCREEN: VPS pricing quick comparison]**
- Basic VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean): $5–20/mo
- Mid-tier (for running multiple services): $20–50/mo
- Running on your own PC: ~$15–30/mo in electricity (estimated, always-on desktop)

> "**Number two: Tool integrations.** Want Claude to send emails? You need an email API. Browse the web? Brave Search API has a free tier but it caps out. Calendar integration? Google API is free but has quotas. Each one is small, but they add up."

**[ON-SCREEN: Integration cost list]**
- Brave Search API: Free (2K queries/mo) → $5/mo (20K)
- Email sending (SendGrid/Resend): Free tier → $20/mo
- Domain + DNS: $10–15/year
- Various API keys and services: $0–30/mo depending on usage

> "**Number three: Your time.** And this is the big one nobody prices in. Setting up an agentic AI system from scratch? Budget 20 to 40 hours if you're technical. If you're not? Either you're paying someone $150 to $500 to do it for you — which is totally reasonable by the way, that's standard market rate — or you're spending 60-plus hours learning."

**[VISUAL: Calculator showing time × hourly rate]**

> "If your time is worth $50 an hour, that 'free open source setup' just cost you a thousand to two thousand dollars in opportunity cost. Be honest with yourself about this one."

> "**Number four: The upgrade treadmill.** New models drop, context windows expand, features release. Each upgrade means testing, adjusting prompts, potentially rewriting integrations. It's not a set-and-forget. Budget 2-4 hours per month for maintenance if you're running a serious setup."

---

## 5) 📊 MONTHLY COSTS BY USAGE LEVEL (8:00–10:00)

**[VISUAL: Three-column layout building simultaneously — this is the KEY chart of the video]**

> "Okay. The moment you've been waiting for. What does this ACTUALLY cost per month? I've broken it into three real-world profiles."

**[CHART CONCEPT: Three vertical bar charts side by side, each bar segmented by cost category with different colors]**

### 🟢 Casual User — "Weekend Tinkerer"
| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Claude Pro subscription | $20 |
| API credits (light use, Haiku/Sonnet) | $5–15 |
| VPS/hosting | $0 (runs on own PC) |
| Integrations | $0 (free tiers) |
| **TOTAL** | **$20–35/mo** |

> "If you're chatting with Claude daily, running a light Clawdbot setup on your own machine, and mostly using it for personal productivity — you're looking at twenty to thirty-five dollars. That's a Netflix subscription plus a coffee."

### 🟡 Power User — "Daily Driver"
| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Claude Pro or Max subscription | $20–100 |
| API credits (Sonnet-heavy, some Opus) | $30–80 |
| VPS hosting | $10–20 |
| Integrations & tools | $10–20 |
| **TOTAL** | **$70–220/mo** |

> "This is where most serious users land. You're using Claude for work, running automations, maybe some coding assistance. The API bill is real but manageable. A hundred to two hundred a month."

### 🔴 Heavy/Professional — "Full Agent Mode"
| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Claude Max subscription | $100–200 |
| API credits (Opus-heavy, high volume) | $200–600 |
| VPS/dedicated server | $20–80 |
| Integrations & premium APIs | $30–50 |
| Maintenance time (valued) | $100–200 |
| **TOTAL** | **$450–1,130/mo** |

> "And if you're going full send — Opus for everything, agents running 24/7, high-volume tool use — yeah, you can absolutely spend a thousand dollars a month. Is it worth it? For some people, absolutely. If Claude is replacing a part-time assistant or saving you ten hours a week, the math checks out instantly."

**[VISUAL: Line graph showing "Cost vs. Hours Saved" with a clear breakeven point]**

> "The question isn't 'is it expensive.' It's 'is it expensive compared to what it replaces.'"

---

## 6) 💡 MONEY-SAVING TIPS (10:00–12:00)

> "Alright, here's where I save you real money. These are the exact strategies I used to cut my monthly bill by sixty percent."

**[VISUAL: Numbered list with icons, each tip animates in]**

> "**Tip one: Model routing.** This is the single biggest cost saver. Don't use Opus for everything. Use Haiku for simple tasks — calendar checks, quick lookups, message routing. Use Sonnet for your daily driver tasks. Reserve Opus for complex reasoning, code architecture, and agentic chains. A smart routing setup can cut your API bill in half overnight."

**[VISUAL: Funnel graphic — tasks flowing to different model tiers]**

> "**Tip two: Prompt caching.** Anthropic supports prompt caching. If you're sending the same system prompt repeatedly — which you are if you're running an agent — caching cuts the cost of that repeated context by up to 90%. This is free money. Turn it on."

> "**Tip three: Trim your context.** Every token in your context window costs money on every single call. If your system prompt is 4,000 tokens and you make 200 API calls a day, that's 800K tokens just on the system prompt. Be ruthless. Cut unnecessary instructions. Summarize conversation history instead of sending full transcripts."

> "**Tip four: Batch non-urgent work.** Anthropic's Batch API gives you 50% off. If something doesn't need a real-time response — analysis, content generation, bulk processing — queue it up and run it in batch."

> "**Tip five: Set hard budget limits.** Anthropic's API lets you set usage limits. Set them. I have a $150 monthly cap on my main project, and a separate budget for experiments. Without a cap, agentic loops can burn through tokens like nothing — I've seen a single runaway loop cost forty dollars in an hour."

> "**Tip six: Use the free tiers strategically.** Brave Search free tier gives you 2,000 queries. Google Calendar API is free. Most email APIs have generous free tiers. Don't pay for integrations until you actually hit the limits."

**[VISUAL: Before/After comparison bar chart]**
- Before optimization: ~$347/mo
- After optimization: ~$140/mo
- Savings: 60%

> "Same functionality. Same results. Just smarter about which model handles what."

---

## 7) 🚫 WHO SHOULD NOT PAY FOR THIS (12:00–13:30)

**[VISUAL: Red "X" marks appearing next to each profile]**

> "Real talk. Not everyone should be spending money on this. Let me save some of you from wasting your cash."

> "**Don't pay if you're just curious.** Claude's free tier exists. The free chat is incredibly capable. Play with it first. For weeks. If you're not hitting limits and wishing you had more, you don't need to upgrade."

> "**Don't pay if you think AI will do your job FOR you.** It won't. It's a force multiplier. If your work output is a zero, ten times zero is still zero. Get good at the fundamentals first, then use AI to amplify."

> "**Don't pay for the API if you don't code or aren't willing to learn.** The chat interface with a Pro subscription is extraordinary. The API is powerful but it requires technical ability to harness. If you can't write a config file, the API will just frustrate you. Get the Pro sub instead, or pay someone to set it up — seriously, two to five hundred dollars for a professional setup is money well spent versus weeks of struggling."

> "**Don't pay for Max if you're not hitting Pro limits.** I see people buying the hundred-dollar plan 'just in case.' Track your usage for a month on Pro first. Most people never hit the limits."

> "**Don't pay if you're in financial hardship.** I know that sounds obvious, but AI FOMO is real. This is a productivity tool, not a lottery ticket. It'll be here when you're ready."

---

## 8) 📢 CTA / OUTRO (13:30–14:30)

**[Cut to talking head, slightly more casual energy]**

> "So there you have it. The real cost of running an AI setup in 2026 — anywhere from twenty dollars to over a thousand, depending on how deep you go. For most people? Budget fifty to a hundred and fifty dollars a month, and you'll have a genuinely powerful system."

> "I'm building something that'll make this whole process easier, by the way. If you want to be the first to know when that's ready, the link's in the description."

**[VISUAL: Subscribe animation + bell icon]**

> "If this saved you from wasting money — or convinced you to actually invest — smash that subscribe button. I'm going deep on the AI agent stack every week: setups, costs, workflows, and the stuff nobody else is showing."

> "Drop a comment: what's YOUR monthly AI budget? I'm genuinely curious where you all land."

> "Next video, I'm breaking down the exact setup I'm running — every tool, every config, every integration. You won't want to miss that one."

**[End screen: Related videos + subscribe button]**

> "I'll see you in that one."
