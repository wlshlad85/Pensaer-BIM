### Gig Description

**Struggling to set up OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/MoltBot)? I'll handle everything so you don't have to.**

Hi! I'm a specialist in OpenClaw deployment and configuration. I've set up dozens of instances across Windows (WSL2), Linux, and cloud platforms — so you get a working AI assistant without the headaches.

**What you get:**
✅ Full OpenClaw installation & configuration
✅ Channel integration (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack)
✅ API key setup with your preferred model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
✅ Cost-optimized model routing to keep your monthly API bill low
✅ Custom SOUL.md personality configuration
✅ Security hardening (DM policies, sandbox mode, gateway tokens)
✅ Tested & verified — I don't deliver until it's working

**Why me instead of doing it yourself?**
- OpenClaw's CLI wizard is great for developers — but most people hit walls with WSL2, API auth, channel pairing, and security config
- I've solved every common error and edge case
- You'll be up and running in hours, not days

**What I need from you:**
- Server access (VPS, home machine, or I can recommend hosting)
- Which channels you want connected
- API provider preference (I'll help you choose if unsure)

⚡ **Fast delivery** — most setups completed within 24 hours.

💬 **Message me before ordering** if you're unsure which package fits. Happy to advise!

### FAQs

**Q: Do I need my own server?**
A: Yes — OpenClaw needs to run somewhere. A $5-10/month VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Railway) works great. I can recommend the best option for your budget and help you set it up.

**Q: How much will the AI cost me monthly after setup?**
A: Depends on usage. Light use: $60-90/month. Moderate: $180-240/month. I configure smart model routing to minimize costs — using cheaper models for simple tasks and premium models only when needed.

**Q: Can you set this up on Windows?**
A: Yes! Windows requires WSL2, which I'll configure for you. It's one of the trickiest parts of setup and a common reason people get stuck.

**Q: What if something breaks after delivery?**
A: Every package includes follow-up support (3-14 days depending on tier). I also offer ongoing monthly support for $29/month if you want peace of mind long-term.

**Q: Is this against Anthropic's Terms of Service?**
A: OpenClaw uses the official API with your own API key — this is fully within Anthropic's TOS. I do NOT set up MAX subscription workarounds.

**Q: Can I see it working before I pay?**
A: Message me and I'll share screenshots/demos from previous setups (anonymized). I also don't mark the order complete until you confirm it's working.

**Q: What channels can you connect?**
A: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, SMS (Twilio), email, and webchat. The Standard and Premium tiers include multiple channels.

### Overview

I set up, configure, and optimize OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/MoltBot) AI assistants — the open-source personal AI platform with 149K+ GitHub stars.

**What I do:**
• Full installation & deployment (Linux, Windows/WSL2, cloud, Docker, Cloudflare Workers)

**Why clients choose me:**

→ Clear communication, fast delivery, and I don't mark it done until you're happy

**Typical projects:**
• "Set up OpenClaw on my VPS with WhatsApp + Telegram" — $99-199, delivered in 1-2 days

### Portfolio Items

**Portfolio Item 1: "Multi-Channel OpenClaw Deployment"**
- *Description:* Complete OpenClaw setup on Ubuntu VPS with WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord channels. Configured smart model routing (Claude Sonnet for casual chat, Opus for complex tasks), reducing the client's projected API costs by ~50%. Custom SOUL.md personality for a business context, 12 skills installed from ClawHub, full security hardening.
- *Results:* Client operational within 6 hours. Monthly API spend: ~$120 vs. projected $250+.
- *Visuals:* Architecture diagram showing channel → OpenClaw → model routing flow. Anonymized screenshot of working multi-channel setup.

**Portfolio Item 2: "Windows WSL2 Setup for Non-Technical User"**
- *Description:* End-to-end setup for a non-developer on Windows 11. Installed WSL2, configured Ubuntu environment, deployed OpenClaw with WhatsApp integration. Created a simple start/stop script and one-page "how to use" guide.
- *Results:* Client went from zero Linux experience to a working AI assistant in one session. Zero support tickets in the first month.
- *Visuals:* Before/after screenshots. Handover documentation sample.

**Portfolio Item 3: "Cost Optimization for Power User"**
- *Description:* Client was spending ~$600/month on API costs with a single-model setup. Implemented multi-model routing: cheap models for simple queries, Claude Opus only for complex reasoning. Added caching layer and token-aware prompting in SOUL.md.
- *Results:* API spend reduced to ~$180/month — 70% savings. No noticeable quality drop for daily use.
- *Visuals:* Cost tracking dashboard before/after. Model routing configuration diagram.

>
> **What I'll do:**
> 1. Diagnose the specific issue via SSH/screen-share

>
> **Scope:**
> - Full OpenClaw deployment on your infrastructure (or I'll recommend and set up hosting)

> **Subject:** I can probably cut your OpenClaw API costs by 40-60%

## Appendix: Competitive Positioning Summary

### How Clawhatch Undercuts & Outdelivers

| Competitor/Alternative | Their Price | Their Weakness | Clawhatch Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| DIY with `openclaw onboard` | Free | Fails for non-devs, WSL2 hell, no cost optimization | We handle everything, optimized from day 1 |
| Discord community free help | Free | Inconsistent, no SLA, no documentation, no follow-up | Guaranteed delivery, docs, support window |
| OpenClawInstaller (Chinese) | Free | Chinese-only, curl\|bash (security risk), no customization | English, secure, fully customized |
| Railway one-click template | Free | Basic config only, no channel setup, no optimization | Full setup including channels, personality, cost tuning |
| Generic Fiverr "bot setup" gigs | $50-300 | No OpenClaw expertise, generic approach | OpenClaw specialist, know every edge case |
| Upwork server config freelancers | $100-500 | Generalists, learning on your dime | Purpose-built for OpenClaw, fixed-price, fast |
| Managed IT services | $500-2000 | Overkill for this scope, slow, enterprise-focused | Right-sized, fast, affordable |

### Pricing Strategy Rationale
- **$49 Basic** — Below the "AI chatbot setup" Fiverr floor ($50-100). Gets foot in door. Profitable because we've automated most of the process.
- **$99 Standard** — Sweet spot. Matches the researched impulse-buy ceiling. Includes cost optimization (unique differentiator that saves clients $100+/month).
- **$199 Premium** — Well below competitor DFY rates ($300-500). Includes everything + monitoring + video walkthrough. Still leaves room for monthly upsell.
- **$29/month support** — The real long-term play. Low enough nobody cancels, high enough to matter at scale.

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **Cost optimization included** — Nobody else does this. We configure model routing that saves $100-400/month on API costs. The setup practically pays for itself in month 1.
2. **Specialist, not generalist** — We only do OpenClaw. That means faster, fewer mistakes, and knowledge of every edge case.
3. **Fixed price, not hourly** — Client knows exactly what they're paying. No bill shock.
4. **It works or you don't pay** — Revision until it's working, follow-up support included.
5. **Documentation included** — Every setup comes with a handover guide. You're not dependent on us forever.
