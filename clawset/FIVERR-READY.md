# Fiverr Gig - Ready to Launch

**Status:** ✅ Ready to publish (NO Calendly dependency)

## Why This Can Launch Now

- Orders come through Fiverr
- Communication via Fiverr messages

- Payments through Fiverr

**No external booking system needed.**

## Launch Strategy

### Option A: Beta Launch (Recommended for Week 1)
**Pricing:** £0 for first 5 orders  
**Goal:** Collect 5-star reviews fast  
**Timeline:** Launch today, get reviews by end of week  
**Then:** Switch to paid pricing with social proof  

**Pro:** Testimonials boost Reddit/Twitter credibility  
**Con:** Zero revenue this week (but worth it for social proof)

### Option B: Paid Launch
**Pricing:** £49/£99/£199 from day one  
**Goal:** Revenue immediately  
**Timeline:** Launch today, wait for organic discovery  

**Pro:** Immediate revenue potential  
**Con:** Harder to get first sale without reviews

### Recommended: Option A
- Launch free tier today (Tuesday)
- Complete 3-5 setups by Friday
- Get reviews posted
- Use reviews in Reddit posts when Calendly is ready
- Switch to paid pricing Monday Feb 10

## Parallel Track with Reddit/Calendly

Fiverr and direct bookings (via Calendly) serve different customers:

| Fiverr | Calendly (Reddit) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Discovery platform | Requires promotion |
| Built-in trust (reviews) | Manual trust-building |
| Fiverr takes 20% fee | Zero platform fees |
| Transactional buyers | Relationship buyers |
| Good for volume | Good for upsells |

**Strategy:** Run both. Fiverr for volume/reviews, Calendly for relationship customers who convert to Support subscription.

---

## Decision Point

**Launch Fiverr today?**
- ✅ YES if you want reviews and social proof this week
- ❌ NO if you want to focus 100% on Calendly bookings

I recommend YES - they don't conflict, and Fiverr reviews boost credibility for all other channels.

**If YES:** Say "launch fiverr" and I'll walk you through it or draft the account setup steps.

**If NO:** I'll continue with security audit checklist and other content.
