Hey [Name]! 

Quick question - are you still drowning in admin work for [their business]?

I just built something that might save you 10+ hours/week. It's an AI system that actually DOES tasks (emails, scheduling, research) instead of just chatting.

I'm looking for 2-3 people to test it this week in exchange for honest feedback. Interested in a 15-min demo?

No pressure either way - just thought of you because I know you're always optimizing your workflow.

- Rich
```

**Template B: Consultant/Freelancer**
```
[Name] - 

Saw your post about [recent thing they mentioned]. 

I'm beta testing an AI automation system that handles the boring parts of client work (email follow-ups, research, scheduling, etc.). 

Looking for a couple people to try it FREE this week in exchange for feedback. 

Worth a 20-min call to see if it fits your workflow?

Setup takes ~1 hour, then it just runs. I'm handling all the technical stuff.

LMK - Rich
```

**Template C: Tech-Savvy Entrepreneur**
```
Hey [Name],

Building an AI orchestration system (Clawhatch) - think "Claude AI, but it can actually control your tools."

Early beta, looking for 2-3 people to test it this week. Free setup + config in exchange for testimonial + feedback.

You'd be perfect for this because [specific reason: you mentioned wanting X / you're already doing Y / etc.]

15 min call this week to demo?

- Rich
```

   - Create simple spreadsheet: Name | Channel | Sent | Response | Next Step
   - Set reminder to follow up in 24h if no response

5. **Follow-Up Template (send after 24h silence):**
```
Following up - totally get it if timing isn't right! 

Just to clarify: this is completely free, I do all the setup, and it'll be running by end of week.

Worth 15 min if you're curious?
```

## 3️⃣ REDDIT GUERRILLA MARKETING

**Time Required:** 2 hours (6 min per comment × 20 comments)  
**Expected Conversion:** 2% (0-1 lead, but builds authority)  
**Goal:** Plant seeds, establish expertise, soft pitch

### TARGET SUBREDDITS

**High Priority:**
- r/Entrepreneur (1M+ members)
- r/SaaS (100K+)
- r/SideProject (200K+)
- r/Freelance (100K+)
- r/AI_Agents (smaller but targeted)
- r/ClaudeAI (hyper-targeted)
- r/AutomateYourself (smaller but high intent)

### EXACT STEPS

1. **Search Strategy (15 minutes)**
   - Search each subreddit for: `"automation workflow"`, `"AI assistant setup"`, `"too much email"`, `"scheduling nightmare"`, `"client communication"`
   - Sort by: New (last 7 days)
   - Open 20 tabs of posts where someone is asking for help

2. **Comment Formula (5 min per comment):**
   - **Lead with value** (2-3 sentences solving their specific problem)
   - **Optional soft pitch** (1 sentence mentioning your solution)
   - **NO hard sell** - you're being helpful first

3. **Comment Templates:**

**Template A: Tool Recommendation Post**
```
I was in the exact same spot last month - [specific pain they mentioned].

Here's what worked for me: [specific tactical advice related to their question].

I ended up building a custom AI orchestration system (gives Claude actual tools instead of just chat) which handles [their specific use case]. Happy to share more if you want to DM, but honestly [their alternative solution] would probably work too if you're not technical.

Main thing: [actionable tip they can use today regardless].
```

**Template B: "How Do I Automate X?" Post**
```
For [their specific task], you've got a few options:

1. [Free/cheap option they can try today]
2. [Mid-tier SaaS solution]
3. Custom AI setup (what I built - gives Claude access to your tools so it can actually execute tasks)

Option 1 is fastest to test. Option 3 is most flexible long-term.

What's your technical comfort level? That'll determine the best path.
```

**Template C: "I'm Drowning in Work" Post**
```
Been there. Here's the brutal truth: [empathetic, honest take on their situation].

Quick wins you can do TODAY:
• [Specific tactic 1]
• [Specific tactic 2]
• [Specific tactic 3]

Longer term, I'd look into AI automation - not ChatGPT (just chat), but actual orchestration where AI controls your tools. I built Clawhatch for this exact reason. DM if you want details, but honestly start with the quick wins first.

You've got this 💪
```

**Template D: When Someone Asks "What Tools Do You Use?"**
```
Current stack:
• Claude AI (via Clawhatch - custom orchestration system)
• [Other relevant tools]
• [Other relevant tools]

The Clawhatch piece is custom (I built it) - lets Claude actually DO things instead of just advising. Handles my email triage, calendar, research, etc.

Not a SaaS (yet), but happy to help anyone set up something similar. It's basically a framework for giving AI real tools.
```

4. **Engagement Rules:**
   - Reply to follow-up questions within 2 hours
   - If someone DMs: move to discovery call immediately
   - If someone asks "how?": offer free setup call
   - Don't spam - spread across subreddits, different days

5. **Track Performance:**
   - Note which subreddits get upvotes/engagement
   - Double down on what works
   - Abandon what gets downvoted/ignored

### DAILY TARGETS
- **Tuesday:** 10 comments (mix of r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, r/ClaudeAI)
- **Wednesday:** 10 comments (mix of r/Freelance, r/SideProject, r/AI_Agents)

### RED FLAGS (Don't Do This)
- ❌ Same comment copy-pasted
- ❌ Mentioning Clawhatch when it's not relevant
- ❌ Ignoring the actual question
- ❌ "Hey check out my tool" with no value
- ✅ DO: Help first, mention second

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No One Is Responding"
**If by Wednesday EOD you have <3 responses total:**
- **Action:** Double down on warm contacts - call them instead of text
- **Action:** Lower friction - offer "10 min demo, no commitment"
- **Action:** Add urgency - "Running beta til Friday, then it's $497"

### "People Are Interested But Not Committing"
**If you have 5+ conversations but no closes:**
- **Action:** Offer free pilot workflow (remove all risk)
- **Action:** Get on phone - voice > text for closing
- **Action:** Ask directly: "What would make this a yes for you?"

### "I Don't Have Time For All This"
**If you can only do 2 hours/day:**
- **Priority 1:** Warm contacts (highest conversion)
- **Priority 2:** LinkedIn (decision makers)
- **Priority 3:** Twitter DMs (leverage)
- **Skip:** Reddit (lowest conversion, highest time)

### "My Demo/Setup Isn't Ready"
**If Clawhatch isn't demo-ready:**
- **Action:** Demo on YOUR instance (show it working for you)
- **Action:** Focus on value/outcomes, not perfection
- **Action:** Sell the pilot - "we'll build it together"

---

## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

**Beta Pricing (This Week Only):**
- Full Setup: ~~$497~~ → **$197** (60% off)
- Pilot Program: **$297** (2 weeks, 3 workflows, money-back guarantee)
- Free First Workflow: **$0** (then $197 for full setup if they want more)

**Why This Works:**
- $197 = impulse purchase territory for small business owners
- "Beta" = exclusivity + forgiveness for rough edges
- "This week only" = urgency
- Money-back guarantee = risk reversal

**Don't Go Lower:**
- Free = no commitment, no value perception
- $97 = too cheap, seems unserious
- $197 = sweet spot (affordable but serious)

**Upsell Path:**
- Month 1: $197 setup
- Month 2+: $97/month support + new workflows
- Month 6: $297/month full managed service

- [ ] Block calendar time for outreach
- [ ] Prepare your demo environment
- [ ] Set up Calendly or booking link
- [ ] Set up Stripe for payments

**Daily habits:**
- [ ] Update tracking spreadsheet 2x/day
- [ ] Follow up on every response within 2 hours
- [ ] Book calls immediately when someone's interested
- [ ] Review what's working, double down
- [ ] Review what's not working, pivot or drop

**Mental game:**
- You're not begging - you're offering value
- "No" is data, not rejection
- Speed matters - book calls same-day if possible
- Perfect is the enemy of done - ship the Fiverr listing even if it's not perfect
- Every conversation is practice for the next one
