## 🚨 Critical Blockers (Still Need Your Action)

### Blocker 1: Stripe Account
**Impact:** Can't accept Concierge tier payments  
**Time:** 15 min  
**URL:** stripe.com/register

## 📞 Discovery Call Framework

*When someone responds to outreach and wants to talk:*

**Goal:** 20-minute qualification call → book beta session or close paid tier

**Structure:**
1. **Intro** (2 min) - "Thanks for responding. Quick background on Clawhatch..."
2. **Discovery** (8 min) - Ask about their use case, pain points, timeline
3. **Pitch** (5 min) - Explain how setup works, benefits, pricing
4. **Close** (5 min) - "Does this sound like a fit? Let's book a session."

**3 closing offers:**
- **Free beta** (if they can do session this week)
- **Paid beta** (£74.50 if they want in on founding pricing)
- **Free first workflow** (if they're unsure, offer value first)

**Templates in playbook** → Section: "Discovery Call Framework"

## 🚀 First Action When You Read This

**Option A: Execute Fiverr (Recommended)**
1. Open `clawset/FIVERR-LAUNCH-GUIDE.md`
2. Follow steps 1-5 (account → content → images → publish)
3. Gig live in 60 minutes

**Option B: Execute Warm Outreach**
1. Open `clawset/OUTREACH-TARGET-LIST.md`
2. Pick 10 people you know
3. Send personalized emails using templates
4. 10 emails sent in 90 minutes

**Option C: Create Calendly (Unblock Reddit)**
1. Go to calendly.com
2. Create event "Free OpenClaw Setup (Beta)", 45 min
3. Send me the link
4. I insert into Reddit posts → you publish → bookings start

**My recommendation:** Do Fiverr first (highest ROI for time), then warm outreach, then Calendly.

## 💬 Questions I Expect You'll Have

**Q: This is a lot. Where do I start?**  
A: Fiverr launch (60 min). It's independent of everything else and can generate revenue while you sleep.

**Q: Do I need to do ALL of this today?**  
A: No. Minimum: Fiverr + 10 warm emails (2.5 hours). Rest is optional/bonus.

**Q: What if Fiverr doesn't get orders?**  
A: That's fine. It's one of 5 channels. Warm outreach and Reddit are higher-priority anyway.

**Q: Should I create Stripe and Calendly now?**  
A: Calendly yes (20 min, unblocks Reddit). Stripe can wait till someone asks to pay.

**Q: What about the landing page fixes?**  
A: Do after outreach executed. Customer acquisition > conversion optimization when you have 0 customers.

**Q: Can I change the playbook?**  
A: Absolutely. It's a starting point, not gospel. Do what feels right for you.
